Over time, a good goal to aim for is 30 minutes of tummy time every day, spread throughout the whole day (it doesn't have to be 30 minutes all in one go).

                        <br> Reading a book with your baby is a good way to start practising sharing in activities together which will be important throughout life. It's also a great one-on-one activity and an easy way for partners and other carers to get involved.

                        <br> Your baby is never too young to have a book read to them! In fact, research shows that children who were read to as newborns have larger vocabularies and more advanced maths skills.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mbn-text">
                        Reading to your baby exposes them to visuals such as letters, shapes and colours (which they will soon start to recognise) and helps them to start understanding emotions through the different characters in the books.

                        <br> Your baby's sight is still developing when they are first born - they are still learning to focus on things and can't see colours straight away.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mbn-text">
                        Because they can really only make out shapes where dark and light meet, books with images that have high contrast, such as those in black, white, grey and maybe even some red, are perfect for reading to your baby over the first couple of weeks.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mbn-text">
                        Young babies can only focus on things that are about 20-30cm away - about the distance from your breast to your face (which is why it's often called the 'cuddle distance'), so make sure you hold the book close too!

                        <br> Babies are born with a great sense of smell, so letting them experience lots of (non-overpowering) scents to see how they react, can be fun for both of you!

                    <p class="mbn-text">
                        <b><u>Why do it?</u></b>
                        <br> Your baby's sense of smell is the most advanced sense they have at birth. It is initially used to stay close to their mother and to find breastmilk.

                    <p class="mbn-text">
                        Smell eventually becomes closely linked to food preferences, so by exposing your baby to lots of different smells over time, you are likely helping them to <a onclick="localSecJump('solids/solids-4112.html#4.1.2f');">accept a wide variety of different foods</a> later on.

                        <br> Getting out into new environments allows for new experiences and learning. Watching other children playing at the playground or even just in a park is stimulating for your baby - the sounds, movement and excitement of other children on the different equipment. In many ways, organised sport is similarly full of all sorts of different sensations for your baby - movement, colours, noises and the excitement of the teams!

                        Watching other children playing, whether that's in a park, on play equipment or as organised sport (a proper game or even just practising) can be interesting and something different for your baby. It might also be a chance for you to bump into other parents and have some adult conversations, which can <a onclick="localSecJump('parents/parents-712.html#7.1.2a');">give your mood a boost</a>.

Some will never crawl with hands and knees, instead favouring the 'bottom shuffle' or 'commando' style (they're all fine) but don't worry if your baby isn't crawling just yet - many babies won't be talented crawlers until around 8 months and others take longer still.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mbn-text">
                        This is also an exciting time for your baby because their imagination comes alive and they're now also better at remembering things such as favourite people, toys and books.

Whether that's 'commando', 'bottom shuffle' or the standard hands and knees crawling doesn't matter - they're all fine from a developmental perspective. Your baby might already be crawling, or they may just want to stay sitting still for a while longer, but they will probably be keen to be on the move from around now.

                        At this age, your baby is having a growth spurt in their brain, which improves their memory. As a result, you might notice them forming stronger attachments to their favourite people, toys and books.

                        <br> Your 9-10 month old is likely to be able to crawl and stand up with some support (e.g. by holding your hand or the furniture) but they might have started <i>walking</i> too - maybe on their own but probably by holding onto your hands or some furniture for balance. If your baby is walking already, then they're an early walker - most babies don't start walking for another couple of months yet!

                        Babbling, babbling, babbling - you'll hear lots of this from your baby as they get closer to saying their first meaningful words! They might already be using 'dada' or 'mama' (or a couple of other words) and by now, should know what these words mean.

                        But if your baby isn't talking yet, don't worry - they will still use body language to communicate with you, make noises to get your attention, and let you know what they want!

                    <p class="mbn-text">
                        Over the past few months your baby has also learned how to show emotions like caution and fear - you might see these emotions if they're worried about strangers or about being apart from you.

                        <br> Introducing babies to lots of different textures and sensations helps build up their understanding of the environment. Cloud dough has just enough form to hold its shape but falls apart easily to let babies create something else!

                    <p class="mbn-text">
                        They can practise their fine motor skills by grabbing and moulding the <i>cloud</i> dough and gripping cups, and use their imaginations by pretending to cook with it.

This is great for strengthening their muscles and practising their balance and coordination as they get ready to start taking their first wobbly steps!

                        If your baby isn't talking just yet though, don't worry - they'll still communicate with you using body language like waving and pointing. And they already understand to stop what they're doing when they hear 'no'.

                            During these months, your toddler might stand up without needing help from you or the furniture, and will probably start to walk on their own!

                            After 14 months, your child might show signs of separation anxiety often and will also begin to show empathy - for example, looking sad or getting upset when they see someone else crying. This is important because learning to show empathy is essential for forming relationships with people as it's about understanding how others might be feeling.

                            <b><i>Oobleck</i></b>
                            <br> Oobleck is a fun activity for everyone - it's like magic in your hands! Oobleck can flow like liquid when held loosely but is solid when held tightly in the hand. The name of the substance comes from Dr. Seuss's 1949 children's book, Bartholomew and the Oobleck. The book is about a king who is bored with the weather in his kingdom and wants something completely new to fall from the sky.

                            If your child can stand, try doing this activity while standing at a table (instead of sitting on a chair or the floor) - this lets them have more freedom to move around and explore the activity fully!

                            <b><u>Why play with Oobleck?</u></b>
                            <br>
                            <i>Oobleck</i> is a type of substance known as a 'non-Newtonian fluid' - it doesn't behave like a solid but it's not quite a liquid either! It's sure to intrigue and confuse both toddlers and adults alike, all the while helping to build up your toddler's understanding of the environment.

                        <p class="mbn-text">
                            Toddlers can practise their fine motor skills by grabbing and moulding the <i>Oobleck</i>, test out how it reacts to different actions and use their imaginations in their play with it.

                        <p class="mbn-text">
                            This all helps to build up their tolerance to new textures, which in turn will help with acceptance of new tastes and textures from a <a onclick="localSecJump('solids/solids-412.html#4.1.2a');">range of different solids foods</a>.
