                <b>What is tummy time?</b>
                <br> Tummy time is when you place your baby on their tummy when they're awake. It forms an important part of your baby's development because it builds up their head, neck and upper body strength, which they will eventually need for when they <a onclick="localSecJump('play-915.html#9.1.5aj');">roll over</a>, <a onclick="localSecJump('play-915.html#9.1.5bi');">sit</a>, crawl, stand and walk.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                In fact, research has shown that babies who regularly practise tummy time in their first 6 months of life (while awake), achieve developmental milestones significantly earlier than those who only do tummy time occasionally in their first 6 months.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Tummy time also breaks up the amount of time a baby spends on their back, which reduces head shape irregularities (flat spots) that can result from weight being constantly applied to the same spot of a baby's soft skull. However, babies should <i>always</i> be <a onclick="localSecJump('sfp/sfp-5114.html#5.1.14a');">put to sleep on their backs</a> to reduce the risk of sudden unexpected death in infancy including SIDS and fatal sleeping accidents.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Newborns often take a little while to get used to lying on their tummy, so it's a good idea to start incorporating tummy time into play <i>every</i> day, soon after your baby is born.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Tummy time can take a number of forms -it doesn't have to just be lying on a blanket on the floor! Check out some <a onclick="localSecJump('9.1.1c');">ideas for encouraging tummy time</a>.
            </p>

            <p class="mbn-text" id="9.1.1b">
                <b>How much tummy time is needed?</b>
                <br> At first, tummy time will probably only last 30 seconds, but with some practice and persistence, your baby should be able to enjoy much longer periods of time on their tummy. Over time, a good goal to aim for is 30 minutes of tummy time spread across the whole day in chunks of time that your baby can manage happily (e.g. 5 minutes, 10 minutes).

                <b>Tummy time tips</b>
                <br> Keeping your baby occupied (or distracted!) is a great way to increase the amount of time they spend on their tummy -you could try:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>playing some soft music, singing a song or talking gently to your baby to create a calm environment
                </li>
                <li>lying down with your face near your baby's face, talking with them and encouraging them to lift their head
                </li>
                <li>blowing bubbles around your baby to see how they respond
                </li>
                <li>lying on your back and laying your baby on your chest, talking to them to encourage them to lift their head to look at you -you can pat or rub their back at the same time to reassure them
                </li>
                <li>placing (or <a onclick="localSecJump('play-915.html#9.1.5ah');">hanging</a>) different things in front of your baby (about 30cm from their face so they can focus on it) for them to look at (move them around to encourage your baby to move their head) for example a:
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>picture book
                    </li>
                    <li>favourite toy
                    </li>
                    <li>photo of a favourite person (a real picture, <a onclick="localSecJump('play-912.html#9.1.2a');">not on a screen</a>)
                    </li>
                    <li>mirror -see if they recognise and react to their reflection!
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>taking <a onclick="localSecJump('play-915.html#9.1.5w');">tummy time outside</a> (on a familiar blanket) to let your baby experience new environments -this helps to stimulate their senses and learning
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mbn-text" id="9.1.1d">
                If your baby is <b>really not</b> enjoying tummy time, even though you've tried all these tips, you could try:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>laying down and letting them lie on your chest so you're faces are close together
                </li>
                <li>laying them across your lap while you're sitting
                </li>
                <li>holding or carrying your baby with their chest resting along your arm with either their head in your hand or around your elbow -this position won't help their arms to get stronger but it will still help their head and neck muscles
                </li>
                <li>prop your baby's chest up a bit with a rolled-up towel so they can lift their head and use their arms to interact with their environment
                </li>
            </ul>
