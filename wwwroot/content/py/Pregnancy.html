                    You're not actually pregnant at the moment. Instead, you have your period. It can be almost impossible to know exactly when your baby was conceived, so it is from the first day of this period that your pregnancy is calculated.

                 If you're hoping to fall pregnant, health professionals recommend that you:
                 <ul>
                    <li>take folic acid: for 3+ months before your pregnancy and then the first 3 months once pregnant
                    </li>
                    <li>get immunised against rubella: the rubella, or German measles, virus can cause abnormalities in the newborn baby if a woman contracts it during the early stages of pregnancy; you may already be protected but if not, it's also best to avoid getting pregnant for one month after the vaccination
                    </li>
                    <li>speak to your GP:
                    </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>have a medical check if you have chronic health problems such as diabetes, epilepsy or high blood pressure
                    </li>
                    <li>discuss any hereditary diseases that might be in your family (your GP may also refer you to a genetic counsellor)
                    </li>
                    <li>check that any medications you're taking are safe during conception and pregnancy
                    </li>

                    If you have a 28-day menstrual cycle, ovulation usually happens around day 14. Having sex 1-3 days <i>before</i> ovulation (or around days 11-13 of your 28-day cycle) will make it more likely you will fall pregnant

        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                    After ovulation, the egg (sometimes two, which, if fertilised, will become non-identical, or fraternal, twins) travels toward your uterus along your fallopian tube. If you've had sex, sperm will also be moving upwards through your cervix towards your uterus.

        <p class="mbn-text">
                    The level of progesterone in your blood will now increase. This lets your body know you're pregnant and causes the endometrium to boost its nutrient supply, which prevents your next period from happening.

                    The fertilised egg will continue along your fallopian tube to your uterus and implant itself into the endometrium - this can take 3-10 days. Some women experience a small amount of bleeding (spotting) around the time of implantation.

        <p class="mbn-text">
                    As soon as conception occurs, the blastocyst (fertilised egg) starts dividing. By the end of this week, it's already become a ball of about 200 cells and is about 4-5mm across.
        </p> 
        <p class="mbn-text">
                  Inside there are three layers forming, each of which will make up a unique part of your baby's body:
                <ul>
                    <li> <i>ectoderm</i> - nervous system, brain, skin and hair

                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

        <p class="mbn-text">
                  The outside of the blastocyst divides into two parts which form critical support structures for your growing baby:
                <ul>
                    <li>outside part - sends out chorionic villi (little tentacles) which bury into the endometrium and will develop into the placenta
                    </li>
                    <li>inside part - becomes the amniotic sac - the bubble filled with fluid which protects the growing embryo
                    </li>
                </ul>
        </p>
        
        <p class="mbn-text">
                   If, during the very early stage of the cell division process, the fertilised egg divides into two and starts forming two babies, identical (or monozygotic) twins will form. They are both from the same egg and same sperm, so have the same genes and will be the same gender.

If you have GBS, you'll be offered intravenous antibiotics against it during <a href="#10.1.1">labour</a> to lower your baby's risk of being infected. Even if you're not tested, if you have certain risk factors for GBS, you'll still be offered the antibiotics during your labour.

                <b>Healthy eating during pregnancy</b>
        </p> 
        <p class="mbn-text">
                    What you eat and drink is vital to your overall health and wellbeing. Whilst eating healthily is important for everyone, it becomes even more so when you're pregnant (and when you are trying to conceive), influencing both your own wellbeing as well as that of your developing baby. For example, eating <a href="#7.1.4">discretionary or 'sometimes' foods</a> (often called junk foods), such as those high in fat and sugar, can <a href="#10.1.3">cause your unborn baby to develop a preference for these foods</a> during childhood and later life.
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">          
                  Healthy eating during pregnancy doesn't have to be hard! It often just means changing the <a href="#10.1.2">amount of different foods</a> you eat so that your diet is varied and nutritious.

                  However, because well-meaning advice from friends and family (and the internet) can often be conflicting and confusing, let's deal with a couple of the common myths first.
        </p>

        <p class="mbn-text" id="10.1.2c">
                <b>Common myths debunked</b>
                <br>
                        <i><u>Myth:</u>  you need to be 'eating for two'</i>
                <br>
                        <i><u>Truth:</u>  there is no need to 'eat for two'</i>
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                Pregnant or not, you've no doubt heard of this one before! The reality is that the amount of food you need depends on many things, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>your weight before you became pregnant
                    </li>
                    <li>how far along you are with your pregnancy
                    </li>
                    <li>how active you are
                    </li>
                </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                The <i>type</i> of food you eat throughout your pregnancy, not the <i>amount</i>, is far more important. For example, you should be eating the same amount of food during the first trimester of your pregnancy as you were before you were pregnant. You may need to eat slightly more during your second and third trimesters, such as an extra piece of fruit per day, but again, this depends on where you are with your pregnancy and how active you are.

                        <i><u>Myth:</u>  cravings are signals of what your baby needs</i>

                Although some women experience cravings for certain foods, there is no evidence that cravings are a sign that your baby needs certain foods. It can be hard, especially if you're struck by a craving, but try to:

                    </li>
                    <li><u>iron:</u> lean red meat, canned tuna, nuts and legumes (as well as many of the folate sources)

                Nausea, heartburn and constipation are quite common during pregnancy. Here are a few things that might help.

                <b>Alcohol in pregnancy</b>
                <br>  
                It is best not to combine alcohol with pregnancy. This includes if you are trying to conceive - it's safest not to drink any alcohol at all. In fact, your partner should also limit his alcohol intake as drinking more than two <a href="#http://www.alcohol.gov.au/internet/alcohol/publishing.nsf/Content/E9E12B0E00E94FD5CA25718E0081F1DC/$File/std0910.pdf">standard drinks</a> per day can affect his fertility too, reducing the chance of a healthy pregnancy.
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                It's safest not to drink any alcohol when pregnant because it can pass through the placenta and into the bloodstream of your developing baby. This can affect the development of your baby's brain and increases your risk of miscarriage and premature birth. In severe cases, drinking alcohol when you're pregnant can cause foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), affecting the physical and mental characteristics of your baby as well as their behaviour. Even small amounts of alcohol during pregnancy can lead to problems with your baby's learning, emotional and social development.
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                Not being able to drink alcohol due to pregnancy affects different people in different ways. How it affects you will depend on how much of a role alcohol normally plays in your life. For example, if alcohol is the way you unwind or manage stress, it's important to look for other ways to <a href="#Link to For Mums > Treat yourself">relax or treat yourself</a>. <a href="#10.1.2">Eating healthily</a> and <a href="#10.1.2">getting active</a> can also help to unwind, so unless your GP or midwife have advised you otherwise, try to get in about 30 minutes of moderate exercise on most days of the week, even if you were not active before your pregnancy.
        </p>

        <p class="mbn-text" id="10.1.2t">
                There's certainly no need to feel like you are missing out, even when out! Opt for non-alcoholic drinks like water, milk, herbal teas, mocktails (e.g. lime and soda instead of vodka, lime and soda) as well as non-alcoholic wines and beers, which are becoming more commonly available. Just remember to watch for added sugars in mocktails (cordials, soft drinks etc) and to always check the label on non-alcoholic drinks as some will still contain small amounts of alcohol.
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                Cutting down or stopping alcohol can be hard if it is a big part of your life but it is best for your health and your baby's. You can always speak with your GP or midwife about cutting back on alcohol and don't forget that there is always someone to talk to and plenty of other support available if you need it, so don't be afraid to reach out!

                Just as smoking is bad for <i>your</i> health, it can also negatively affect <i>all</i> stages of having a baby, including falling pregnant in the first place, which can be harder if either you or your partner smokes.

                Once you're pregnant, if you smoke, or are around other people's smoke - even the smoky smell left on clothing/hair/furniture for example - your baby smokes too.
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                 This brings with it many risks, including an increased chance of:

                    <li>reduce your <a href="#10.1.3">milk supply</a> and put harmful substances into your breastmilk (however, breastfeeding is still best choice for your baby, even if you do smoke)

        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                Smoking during pregnancy and/or exposing your baby to smoke once they're born is also strongly linked with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).

                <b>Breastfeeding is a learned skill</b>  
                <br>   
                Because breastfeeding is so natural, you'd be forgiven for thinking that as soon as your baby is born and placed near your breast, it will all just happen and that's that. 
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                But, the reality is that just like riding a bike or playing a musical instrument, breastfeeding is a skill that we must <i>learn</i> in order to do it successfully. In fact, it can take a mum and her baby 6-8 weeks to figure out what works best for them!       
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                It's quite common to find breastfeeding hard but it is also important to persist - the majority of problems can be overcome and there is no need to feel like a failure and give up. There's also no need to worry if <a href="#10.1.5">your own mum was unable to breastfeed</a> - it's not genetic, so there's no reason you won't be able to.      
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                Many new mums also don't realise that there is <a href="#8.1.5">plenty of support available</a> (much of it free) to help them breastfeed their baby - which is hardly surprising given that breastmilk is the only food that a new baby needs until they're around 6 months old!

               There are many benefits to breastfeeding, and not just for you and your baby!. 
        </p>

        <p class="mbn-text" id="10.1.3d">
                Breastfeeding can <b>help you and your partner:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><u>save money and time</u> - you don't need to <i>buy</i> breastmilk, so it's far cheaper than using formula (a single tin of formula costs around $25 and once open, must be used within a month), and because breastmilk is always clean, warm and ready, it's also far more convenient. As an added bonus, you won't need to sterilise bottles and teats, boil water or mix formula and, there is much less washing up!
                    </li>
                    <li><u>get more sleep</u> - mums who breastfeed tend to get back to sleep more quickly and easily than mums who bottle feed (and there's no need for someone to spend time warming up the milk!).
                    </li>
                    <li><u>with changing nappies</u> - your baby's poo should be softer and easier to clean up (and not as smelly).
                    </li>
                </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="mbn-text" id="10.1.3e">
                It can also <b>help you</b> to:
                <ul>
                    <li><u>bond with your baby</u> - the <a href="#10.1.3">skin-to-skin contact</a> gives you a physical connection with your baby and enhances bonding and attachment.
                    </li>
                    <li><u>recover after pregnancy</u> - the hormones produced when you breastfeed help to contract your uterus back down to its pre-pregnant size and shape within a few weeks after you give birth, reducing the chances of excessive bleeding after delivery.
                    </li>
                    <li><u>lose weight</u> - making breastmilk uses lots of energy (kilojoules/calories) so it helps you to lose excess <a href="#10.1.2">weight you may have gained during pregnancy</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li><u>lower your risk of illness later in life</u> - breastfeeding lowers your risk of developing certain cancers (including breast and ovarian), osteoporosis and type 2 diabetes.

                <b>Your baby benefits</b> from breastfeeding because:
                <ul>
                    <li><u>breastmilk is their perfect food</u> - it is easily digested, contains all the fluid, energy and nutrition they need until they're around 6 months old and, as they grow, it continues to change to meet all their nutritional needs.
                    </li>
                    <li><u>it boosts their immune system</u> - breastmilk contains a special blend of antibodies that helps protect your baby from illnesses such as gastroenteritis, chest infections, ear infections and urine infections. Eczema, asthma, obesity and type 1 diabetes are all less likely in babies who are breastfed.
                    </li>
                    <li><u>it protects against sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI)</u> - the risk of dying from SUDI reduces by more than 50% in babies who are breastfed
                    </li>
                    <li><u>it promotes emotional security and brain development</u> - the bonding and attachment of <a href="#10.1.3">skin-to-skin contact</a> with you is comforting and nurturing for your baby and even enhances their childhood independence, whilst your breastmilk also contains important fatty acids that help to develop your baby's brain.

                <ul>
                    <li><u>it's environmentally friendly</u> - breastmilk needs far fewer natural resources to make and produces no waste.
                    </li>
                    <li><u>breastfed babies are healthier</u> - they are less likely to need medical attention which reduces the cost to governments, insurers and healthcare services.

                <b>Colostrum or 'first milk'</b> 
                <br>
                During pregnancy, your breasts will develop in preparation for breastfeeding and will begin storing colostrum or 'first milk', which will be ready for your baby to drink at birth. Colostrum is your baby's perfect first food.
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                Colostrum is:
                <ul>
                    <li><u>thick, sticky and golden yellow in colour</u>
                    </li>
                    <li><u>rich in protein and secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA)</u> - an antibody which takes over from the antibody that protects your baby via their blood circulation during pregnancy (IgG). IgA boosts your baby's immune system by lining the mucous membranes in their throat, lungs and intestines (which are very leaky) with a barrier that stops most foreign substances from being absorbed.
                    </li>
                    <li><u>high in white blood cells</u> - to help defend your baby against bacteria and viruses
                    </li>
                    <li><u>easy for your baby to digest</u>

                    </li>

        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                Because your baby's <a href="#1.1.1">tummy is so small</a> when they are first born, it's important to <a href="#10.1.3">keep feeding them small amounts, often</a>. This ensures they get all the nutrition they need. Feeding frequently also stimulates your breasts to make more milk and <a href="#10.1.3">set up your milk supply</a>.      
        </p>

        <p class="mbn-text" id="10.1.3j">
                <b>When breastmilk comes in</b> 
                <br>
                Between days 3-5, <a href="#10.1.3">colostrum</a> will start to transition into mature breastmilk, a process that continues until two weeks after birth. The quantity increases rapidly, and the milk becomes less sticky and changes to a more white or opaque colour. You may even notice that at around days 3-5 your breasts will suddenly become very full and firm!
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                As your breasts increase the amount of milk they make, your baby keeps growing, as does their tummy. By days 3-5 your baby's tummy should be the size of a golf ball but by day 10, it will have reached the size of a chicken egg!     
        </p>

        <p class="mbn-text" id="10.1.3k">
                <b>Milk supply</b> 
                <br>
                By suckling at your breasts, your baby sends powerful messages to your body to make more milk ready for their next feed. This is controlled by two main hormones - prolactin and oxytocin - which are released into your bloodstream when your baby stimulates the nerve endings in your nipples by sucking.
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                Prolactin helps to make milk and build your supply while oxytocin makes the milk to spurt into your baby's mouth - known as the let-down reflex. The more often you have a let-down reflex and the more milk that is removed from your breasts, the more milk will be made.    
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                Provided you feed your baby when <a href="#5.1.4">they're hungry</a>, they are <a href="#10.1.3">attached on properly</a> and you let them feed for as long as they need to feed, your body will adapt to providing just what your baby needs.    
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                It is worth keeping in mind that your milk supply can take <a href="#10.1.3">around 6 weeks to establish</a> and if anything interrupts this process, it might start to decrease, so it's best to avoid:
                <ul>
                    <li>trying to feed by the clock instead of when your baby <a href="#5.1.4">is hungry</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>giving formula or water instead of a breastfeed
                    </li>
                    <li>limiting the length or frequency of feeds in any way
                    </li>
                    <li>giving your baby <a href="#10.1.3">a dummy or teat</a> to suck instead of a breastfeed
                    </li>
                </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                It's also a good idea not to schedule any major jobs for the first 6-8 weeks so you can just <a href="#7.1.3">rest</a>, <a href="#10.1.3">breastfeed</a> and enjoy your baby.

                Skin-to-skin contact also ensures that your baby feels secure and <a href="#10.1.3">stimulates hormones</a> that help to start breastfeeding, in both you and your baby, so your baby can begin to breastfeed as soon as they're ready. 
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                Before your baby is born, it's a good idea to ask your <a href="#8.1.2">midwife</a> or obstetrician if they support immediate skin-to-skin contact with your baby after birth. If they don't (and immediate skin-to-skin contact with your baby is something that you would like) this gives you some time to discuss this further with them and emphasise its importance to you.

        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                The distance from your breast to your face is often called 'cuddle distance' because this is the best distance for a baby to be able to focus on your face. As you talk to your baby after the birth, they will make the connection between your face and your <a href="#10.1.3">voice which will be so familiar from the womb</a>.

                By <a href="#10.1.1">20 weeks of pregnancy</a>, your unborn baby can hear all sorts of sounds - your voice, heartbeat and digestion noises, as well as the music you listen to. In fact, newborn babies can usually recognise music they heard frequently when they were still in the womb!
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                Music and stories are a great way to start connecting with your baby during pregnancy. Mums are lucky because their baby will hear them all day long but your partner and other family members who will be around your baby after birth can also bond by talking and singing to your belly regularly. It doesn't have to be anything special - even talking about the football or cricket is fine - it all helps your baby to get to know the sound of your voices!

                By the second trimester of pregnancy, your baby can taste your individual body odours and even taste some of the flavours of your diet through the amniotic fluid they're swallowing in utero. <a href="#10.1.2">Eating healthily</a> during your pregnancy and including lots of <a href="#10.1.2">vegetables</a> and <a href="#10.1.2">fruit</a> in your diet, will help your baby get used to these foods.

        <p class="mbn-text">
                Once born, your baby will be drawn to the sweetish flavour of your breastmilk and it, along with your sweat, will remind your baby of the tastes they experienced in the womb.

                In late pregnancy, your baby is tucked up snuggly inside your uterus so you can imagine how, at birth, your baby may suddenly feel insecure when there is suddenly so much room in this bright and cold atmosphere for their arms and legs to flail about!

                If you were to start a new job or move to a new country, you wouldn't expect to adjust immediately - having a baby, becoming a mum and breastfeeding is no different. Although natural, <a href="#10.1.3">breastfeeding is a learnt skill</a> that takes time and practice but there is <a href="#8.1.5">plenty of support</a> available to help you.
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                Many women find that if they invest time in their <a href="#7.1.6">new role as a mum</a> and plan nothing else for the first couple of months, transition to motherhood goes more smoothly.
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                To give you the most time to focus on being a mum to your baby, try to avoid anything major in the first 6-8 weeks, such as:
        
                 <ul>
                    <li>building a house or putting in an extension (unless you can move out)
                    </li>
                    <li>taking on large or stressful projects like planning a wedding or sorting out your financesproduce fewer stress hormones
                    </li>
                    <li>moving house or living with friends/family members who get under your skin
                    </li>
                    <li>things that require sticking to a schedule - haircuts, dentist appointments, manicures etc - try to do these routine things <i>before</i> you give birth because life with a new baby can be unpredictable!

        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                The main thing is that your baby needs to be positioned chest-to-chest with you, so they don't have to turn their neck to suck. Your baby's head also needs to be gently extended so they can drink freely.
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                A good motto to remember is <i>'chest-to-chest, nose-to-nipple'</i>.

        <p class="mbn-text">
                Some of the most popular feeding positions are:
                 <ul>
                    <li>the cradle hold

        <p class="mbn-text">

        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                You may also have heard that a dummy is a great way to keep your baby contented.

It's also not recommended <a href="#1.1.10">to use a dummy</a> (or a bottle) until your <a href="#10.1.3">milk supply</a> is established (which can take up to 6-8 weeks).

        <p class="mbn-text">
                Expressing isn't as good as your baby is at getting milk out of your breasts (so it can't be used to 'measure' how much milk you make) and there are <a href="#1.1.11">many ways</a> to do it, some of which include using a <a href="#1.1.17">breast pump</a>.

                The <a href="#10.1.3">day your baby is finally born</a> will likely be a huge emotional mix of excitement and exhaustion, so it's a good idea to know ahead of time what to expect from your baby in their first week.

                <br>
                On the first day, your baby will produce poo called 'meconium' that looks a bit like thick, sticky Vegemite - this is normal! Don't worry, as your baby starts getting <a href="#10.1.3">colostrum</a> through their system, their poo will become less sticky and much easier to clean up.
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                Keeping an eye on what's in your baby's nappy is a great way to tell whether they're getting enough breastmilk. Over the first week, your baby should be producing progressively more wet nappies soaked through with clear or pale yellow wee.
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                The number of expected wet nappies that your baby should produce each day should match the number of days since your baby's birth, so expect 1 wet nappy on day 1, 2 on day 2, 3 on day 3 etc, up until your baby is producing at least 6-8 wet nappies soaked through <a href="#10.1.3">from day 6 onwards</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                Your baby may produce a few soft poos or bowel movements every day, although fully breastfed babies might only poo every few days - it varies quite a bit. As the week goes by, your baby's poos should begin to change:
                 <ul>
                    <li>day 1: black, thick and sticky 'meconium'
                    </li>
                    <li>days 2-3: gradually getting less sticky and brown/greenish

                <b>Normal newborn weight changes</b> 
                <br>
                After you have had skin-to-skin contact and the first breastfeed on the day your baby is born, your midwife will offer to weigh your baby to record their birth weight. It is normal for babies to lose up to 10% of their birth weight in the first few days but they usually regain their birth weight again by week 2-3.
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                Knowing your baby's birth weight is a good way to monitor their growth and weight gain, and therefore that they're feeding well.If your baby loses more than 10% of their birth weight or is not tracking well on the growth chart, your midwife may give you individualised feeding advice.

                <b>Rooming-in</b> 
                <br>
                For the first 6-12 months, it is recommended to keep your baby in a cot in your room as this has been shown to reduce the risk of sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI), including SIDS.
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                Also called 'rooming-in', keeping your baby in your room with you all the time will help you get to know your baby quickly. You will learn to start to recognise their unique facial expressions, sounds and body movements which will help you to understand what they're trying to communicate, for example, are they hungry or tired?
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                Rooming-in allows you to respond to your baby appropriately and to breastfeed them whenever they are hungry. This is one of the reasons that rooming-in makes breastfeeding easier and helps you to build and maintain your milk supply.
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                Babies who room-in with their mums tend to:
                 <ul>
                    <li>cry less
                    </li>
                    <li>settle more quickly (which means more sleep for you!)
                    </li>
                    <li>take in more breastmilk
                    </li>
                </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                Not surprisingly, rooming-in is now standard in almost all hospitals and birth centres in Australia for mums and healthy term babies.

                <b>Knowing when to feed your baby</b> 
                <br>
                You should feed your baby whenever they're hungry and for as long as they want to feed. For newborn babies, this means a total of 8-12 feeds over 24 hours, although some may need more than this and some may need less. Needing several feeds on top of one another, or 'cluster feeding', is also quite normal.

                    </li>
                    <li>avoid giving your baby any supplements, water, teats or dummies.

                <b>Birth choices</b> 
                <br>
                Being in Australia means that you are fortunate to have a say in where you give birth, for example, in a public or private hospital, a birth centre or at home. With each setting, the types of carers (e.g. midwife, GP and obstetrician) who will look after you during your pregnancy, birth and once your baby is born, will also change.
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                So what should you choose? Having all of that choice can present problems, especially if this is your first baby or you don't really know all the pros and cons of the different settings.

                <b>Preparing your home</b> 
                <br>
                Often referred to as 'nesting', getting your home ready to welcome a new baby can be a great way to help you and your partner, as well as any other children you have, to prepare for your new baby's arrival.
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                As an added bonus, most of the things you need to do in order for your home to be safe for your baby are not about making major changes, but really just about knowing what to expect.
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                To make sure your home is ready, consider the following questions.
        </p>

        <p class="mbn-text" id="10.1.4e">
                <b>Where will your baby sleep?</b> 
                <br>
                You might not have the time or space to make a new room for your baby and that's OK because your baby can easily fit into a corner of your bedroom and having your baby room-in for the first 6-12 is the safest option for reducing the risk of SIDS anyway.
        </p>

        <p class="mbn-text" id="10.1.4f">
                <b>Where will you change nappies?</b> 
                <br>
                Buying a change table is common but changing your baby on a bed or on a mat on the floor are also options. Although some parents find that a change table is easier on their backs, at home, it's actually safer to change your baby on a mat on the floor, where there is no chance of falling.
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                Whichever option you choose, always put your baby's safety first. So if you're changing on a change table or a bed, <b>always keep your hands on your baby at all times</b> to stop them from rolling off.
        </p>

        <p class="mbn-text" id="10.1.4g">
                <b>Where will you bath your baby?</b> 
                <br>
                Your baby doesn't need any special bathing area prepared! In fact, provided it's safe and clean, you can even bath your newborn in the laundry tub or kitchen sink!

        <p class="mbn-text" id="10.1.4j">
                General equipment:

                    <li><u>an Australian Standards-approved rear-facing child restraint</u> (AS/NZS 1754) - try to have this professionally fitted before your baby arrives, especially if you plan on driving home from hospital or birth centre
                    </li>
                    <li><u>an Australian Standards-approved baby cot</u> (AS/NZS 2172:2003) and a firm, well-fitting mattress, and sheets for your baby's sleep safety - although some parents use a crib or bassinette for the first few months, a full-sized cot is both cost-effective and safe
                    </li>
                    <li><u>nappies</u> - it's best to keep a few disposables handy just in case, even if you plan to use reusable nappies
                    </li>
                    <li><u>an Australian Standards-approved pram or stroller</u> (AS/NZS 2088) if you plan on getting out and about with your baby
                    </li>

                    </li>
                    <li>baby wraps - have a few on hand including muslin if it's summer

                There are so many products available and some of it can be really expensive! After you have the essentials covered, some of the following items might be of use, but it's always a good idea to question whether you'd actually use them or are just following what advertisers or friends/family are telling you.
        </p>

        <p class="mbn-text" id="10.1.4n">
                Some items you might find helpful:

                    <li><u>nappy bin with lid</u> for home and single disposable nappy bags for when you're out - placing soiled nappies in your usual bin or using old plastic bags instead is another option
                    </li>
                    <li><u>baby bath</u> - using the kitchen sink or laundry tub can be fine, provided they're clean
                    </li>
                    <li><u>soft towels</u> for drying and wrapping your baby after bath time
                    </li>
                    <li><u>a musical mobile</u> for capturing your baby's attention and helping them to settle
                    </li>
                    <li><u>baby carrier, sling or backpack</u> - these can be great for letting you go hands free when out and about with your baby, provided they're used correctly
                    </li>
                </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="mbn-text" id="10.1.4o">
                Items best avoided:
                 <ul>
                    <li><u>talcum powder</u> - your baby might breathe in its fine particles and it can also get into your baby's genitals and cause damage to internal structures
                    </li>
                    <li><u>a baby walker</u> - these can be dangerous and children left unattended have been hurt

        <p class="mbn-text">
                There are many ways you can save money on baby equipment, starting with buying only what you need. A good way to avoid marketing gimmicks is to talk with other parents to see what they've found useful.

                Although you probably feel thirsty when the weather is hot, there is no need to give your baby any extra fluids - until 6 months, they will get all the nutrition (and fluid) they need from <a href="#10.1.3">your breastmilk</a>. 
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                Instead, when it is hot, you might find that your baby will want to have smaller breastfeeds, more often. This is not so different to us drinking more often when it's hot, so make sure you drink plenty of water to keep your own fluids up.
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">

        <p class="mbn-text">
                Once your <a href="#10.1.3">milk supply</a> is established (usually around 6-8 weeks) and your baby is breastfeeding well, there is no reason why they can't have the occasional <a href="#10.1.10">bottle of expressed milk</a>
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                However, it is not recommended to give your baby bottles <i>earlier</i> than 6 weeks as this can make them reluctant to breastfeed because sucking milk from your breast takes more work than getting it from a teat!

                <br>
                For the first 6 months of your baby's life, breastmilk provides all of the nutrients your baby needs. Even once they have started solids, breastmilk will still continue to be an important source of nutrients until your baby is at least 12 months.
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                You will know when your baby is ready for solids as they <a href="#4.1.1">will show signs</a> and although these signs happen at <i>different times for different babies</i>, most babies will show signs around 6 months of age.

                <br>
                Breastmilk is the perfect food for your baby and as your baby grows, <a href="#10.1.3">your breastmilk changes to meet their needs</a>. Because it is a complete food, supplying all the fluid, energy and nutrition that your baby needs until they are around 6 months old, there's no need to give your baby anything else (such as water, fruit juice or supplements), unless you have been specifically advised to do so by your GP or <a href="#1.1.9">maternal and child health nurse</a>. 
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                At about 6 months, when ready, your baby can start to experiment with <a href="#4.1.2">soft solid foods</a>. As solid foods start to play more of a role in your baby's diet, their need for breastmilk will slowly go down, but it will still be an important source of nutrients until your baby is at least 12 months.

                No. Breastfeeding <a href="#10.1.3">is a <i>skill</i> that we must learn</a> and there is no evidence to suggest that breastfeeding difficulties or <a href="#1.1.3">low milk supply</a> run in families.
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                What <i>can</i> be more of a challenge, however, is if a woman <i>wants</i> to breastfeed, but her own mother either does not support her decision to breastfeed or lacks knowledge about how breastfeeding works.
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                It is worth keeping in mind that we know a lot more about how to <a href="#10.1.3">build milk supply</a> and what babies need, than we did decades ago. For example, your mother may have been told to set a routine and feed you by the clock but we now know that babies need to be fed when they're hungry, rather than just at set times of the day. 
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
               Successful breastfeeding depends on the <a href="#1.1.9">right support</a> from family and friends, so make sure you talk to your family (including <a href="#1.1.9">your partner</a>, if you have one) about how you wish to feed your baby early on, before your baby is born if possible. You might even wish to let them play with this app so they can then be on the same page as you when your baby arrives.

Take our <a href="#Link to bottle feeding quiz">bottle feeding quiz</a> and <a href="#Link to formula preparation quiz">formula preparation quiz</a> to check you have got the basics of bottle feeding covered!
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Most formulas are based on cow's milk that has been modified to meet a baby's main nutritional needs. If a baby cannot take cow's milk based products for specific medical, cultural or religious reasons,special formulas might be used under medical supervision.
            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Babies under 12 months of age <b>should not</b> have normal cow's milk or dairy alternatives such as soy, rice, almond or coconut milk. The make-up of these products can harm a baby's developing body. 
            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                There are 2 main types of formula:

                One of these nutrients is protein. Formulas available in Australia can have protein ranging between 1.3-10.0g per 100mL of made up formula. By comparison breastmilk contains 1-1.1g of protein per 100ml. Research shows that it might be best to choose a formula with lower amounts of protein to ensure optimal long-term growth.
            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                You can compare the protein content of different formulas by:
            </p> 
                <ul>
                    <li>finding the <i>Nutrition Information Panel</i> (a table) on the packet
                    </li>
                    <li>look for protein on the left hand column
                    </li> 
                    <li>running your finger across to look at the amount of protein in the <b>'per 100mL of prepared formula'</b> column (see example below) - this lets you compare the amount of protein in different formulas
                    </li>      
                </ul>
            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Try to choose a formula <b>with the <i>lowest</i> amount of protein (closer to 1.3g per 100mL</b> prepared/made up formula).

            ADD TABLE

            <p class="mbn-text">
                    You might also notice that many formulas have special claims displayed on the packaging. In most cases, these claims usually have very little or even no evidence that they actually make the quality of the formula any better, so it's best to ignore these sorts of claims.
            </p>  
            <p class="mbn-text">
                    It is recommended that you choose your baby's formula based on:
                <ul>
                    <li>your baby's needs
                    </li>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                  <b>and</b>
            </p> 
                    <li>the protein content (see above)
                    </li>   
                </ul>
            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                    For healthy full-term babies, there is little evidence to say that one formula is better than another is. However, just keep in mind that there <i>are</i> some formulas available to buy that are <b>not</b> recommended without first consulting your GP or your <a href="#8.1.4">maternal and child health nurse</a>.
            </p>  
            <p class="mbn-text">
                    So unless your GP or <a href="#8.1.4">maternal and child health nurse</a> advises you otherwise, the only type of formula your baby will need until they are 12 months old is <a href="#10.1.2">starter or first formula</a> (sometimes labelled step 1 or stage 1 or from birth). Research has shown no advantages to using <a href="#10.1.2">follow-on formula (or stage/step 2)</a> for babies aged 6-12 months and it is not necessary. Follow-on or step 2 formulas tend to have higher amounts of protein than your baby needs. So for optimal growth stick with starter or first formula and choose one with a lower amount of protein.
            </p>  
            <p class="mbn-text">
                    Once your baby has reached 12 months, they can then have regular full cream cow's milk. Most healthy toddlers do not need <a href="#10.1.2">formula, stage 3 formulas or toddler milk</a>.

                <b>Why sterilise?</b>
            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                    Your baby's immune system is still developing so tummy upsets can easily happen. Sterilising all feeding equipment can reduce the risk of this happening by killing any harmful bacteria.
            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                  There are three different ways to sterilise equipment:
                <ul>
                    <li>boil sterilisation
                    </li>
                    <li>chemical sterilisation
                    </li>
                    <li>steam sterilisation
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <b>Before you sterilise</b>
            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                  Before you begin to sterilise the feeding equipment, you should:
                <ul>
                    <li class="mbn-ol"> Wash your hands well with soap and water (antiseptic rubs don't always kill all the germs).
                    </li>
                    <li class="mbn-ol"> Clean the bench or work surface where you will put together the bottle and teat with hot, soapy water.
                    </li>
                    <li class="mbn-ol"> Clean all equipment well using a <a href="#10.1.1">bottle/teat</a> brush and rinse with clean, hot soapy water.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                  Once these three steps are done, you're ready to start sterilising!
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Dishwashers can be used to <i>clean</i> feeding equipment but they <b>will not sterilise it</b>, as the temperatures reached are not high enough. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions.
            </p>

            <p class="mbn-text" id="10.1.3c">
                    <b>Boil sterilisation</b>

            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Boil sterilisation uses boiling water on a stovetop and is the best option for consistent and reliable results.
            </p>

            <p class="mbn-text">
                  How to do it:
                <ul>
                    <li class="mbn-ol"> Fill a pot with water and submerge the feeding equipment completely, making sure there is no air trapped inside.
                    </li>
                    <li class="mbn-ol"> Cover with a lid, place on the back burner of the stove and bring to the boil.
                    </li>
                    <li class="mbn-ol"> Boil for <i>at least</i> 5 minutes, making sure that all items stay under the surface of the water.
                    </li>
                    <li class="mbn-ol"> Turn off the burner and let the equipment cool in the pot until you can comfortably handle it.
                    </li>
                    <li class="mbn-ol"> Store any equipment not being used immediately in a container in the fridge.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                  Some feeding equipment is not safe to boil (be sure to check first) and teats also tend to get damaged faster with this method, which means you'll need to replace them more often to avoid making your baby sick.
            </p>

            <p class="mbn-text">
                  Always take care to ensure safety and prevent scalds/burns and <i>never</i> leave hot pans and liquids unattended, especially if children are around.

                   Wherever possible, only remove the feeding equipment from the steriliser/sterilising solution <b>just before</b> you need to use it. If you need sterilise now for later use, put the bottle together fully with the teat and lid in place - this will help prevent the inside of the bottle and the inside and outside of the teat from being contaminated.

            <p class="mbn-text">

            <p class="mbn-text">
                   It is best if a feed is made up just before your baby needs it. However, if you need to store a feed for future use, there are some guidelines you should follow to reduce the risk of your baby developing a tummy upset or other infection.
            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                How to store made up formula (that you haven't yet offered to your baby):
            </p> 
                <ul>
                    <li><i><u>Refrigerator:</u></i>place on the top shelf at the back of the fridge (where it is coldest) no longer than 1 hour after making but throw away after 24 hours.
                    </li>
                    <li><i><u>Cool bag with ice pack:</u></i> throw away after 2 hours (as cool bags don't always keep foods chilled properly).
                    </li> 
                    <li><i><u>Room temperature:</u></i> throw away after 1 hour.
                    </li>      
                </ul>
            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                    If there is formula left in the bottle after a feed, don't store it, throw it away!
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                    Bacteria multiply very quickly at room temperature and can still survive and grow inside the fridge (although more slowly). The risk of bacteria multiplying in your baby's bottle increases with the length of time a made up formula is stored, making it unsafe for them to drink.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                    A good rule of thumb is: <i>if in doubt, throw it out!</i>

                    <b>1. Fill the scoop <i>loosely</i> and level it off</b>
                    <br>
                  The formula powder should not be packed into the scoop tightly or heaped up over the top. Packing the scoop loosely and levelling it off ensures that your baby's formula will not be too concentrated for their small body to handle. If formula is made up too concentrated, it can cause your baby to develop 'osmotic diarrhoea'. This is when your baby's body tries to dilute the concentrated formula sitting in their gut by mixing in water that has been sucked out of other parts of their body, which can cause them to become dehydrated.

            <p class="mbn-text">
                    If your baby's formula continues to be made up too concentrated (by continuing to add too much formula powder into the scoop), it can cause severe dehydration in your baby, which could lead to a rare but serious condition called 'hypernatraemic dehydration'. Sadly, it's quite common not to notice symptoms of this condition until your baby has neurological problems, which can be permanent.

            <p class="mbn-text">
                    This is why it is so important to always loosely fill and then level off the formula powder in the scoop when making up a feed for your baby.

            <p class="mbn-text">
                Feeding your baby not only provides them with nourishment but also helps with bonding, emotional security and physical development. Surprisingly, it also has the capability to increase literacy (speaking, reading and writing) skills!
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
               The more you sing, read, smile, and talk to your baby the more it activates cell growth and cellular connections in their brain. These connections form the early neural circuitry that will eventually be the foundation for learning.

            <p class="mbn-text">
               So holding your baby while feeding them a bottle is an ideal time for you both to connect <i>and</i> to increase their ability to learn!

               The below steps are a guide to feeding your baby with a bottle:
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
               <b>Sit comfortably and hold your baby close</b>, looking into their eyes to help them feel safe, protected and loved.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
               <b>Hold your baby upright</b>, with their head supported so that they can breathe and are able to swallow comfortably.
            </p>
             <p class="mbn-text">
               <b>Brush the teat against your baby's lips</b> and when your baby's mouth opens wide, let them draw in the teat.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
               <b>Hold the bottle horizontal to the ground</b>, tilting it just enough to ensure your baby is getting milk, not air, through the teat - you will see bubbles in the bottle as your baby feeds.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
               <b>If you can't see any bubbles</b>, break the suction between your baby's tongue and the teat by moving the teat slightly to the side of their mouth until you can see bubbles.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
               <b>If the teat becomes flattened</b> while you are feeding, pull gently on the corner of your baby's mouth to release the vacuum.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
               <b>When your baby does not want any more feed</b>, hold them upright and gently rub or pat their back to <a href="#10.1.9">burp them</a> - there may not be much wind to bring up. If there is any formula left over, throw it away. Resist the urge to <a href="#10.1.5">encourage your baby to finish it</a> - there is no need for your baby to finish a bottle if they have shown you their <a href="#5.1.4">fullness signs</a>.
            </p>
            
            <p class="mbn-text" id="10.1.5c">
               <b>Do not add cereal, cordial, tea, honey or flavourings</b> to a bottle. 
               Doing so is unsafe and can cause several problems, including <a href="#10.1.5">overfeeding</a> your baby. If you are thinking about adding anything to your baby's bottles other than formula, speak with your GP or <a href="#8.1.4">maternal and child health nurse </a> first.

                    <b>Tips:</b>
               <ul>
                    <li>Babies feed in bursts of sucking with short pauses to rest and sometimes burp, so don't stress if your baby doesn't suck continuously.
                    </li>
                    <li>Interrupting the feed now and again lets your baby notice how 'full' they feel so they don't overfeed.
                    </li>
                    <li>Always hold your baby and never leave them unattended while feeding from a bottle. This includes <a href="#10.1.5">never leaving them to fall asleep with a bottle</a> - night or day.
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="#10.1.5">Never prop your baby up with the bottle</a> - this can be a choking hazard, particularly if they fall asleep.
                    </li>
                    <li>Letting your baby drink from a bottle <a href="#10.1.5">while lying down</a> can increase the risk of ear infections and tooth decay.

                Rather than make up a feed and then take it with you, it is much safer to prepare a bottle of formula once you're out, just before your baby needs a feed.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">

                Formula that has already been made up must be <a href="#10.1.4">stored correctly</a>. If you have access to a refrigerator (to keep formula at or below 5°C) it formula will last up to 24 hours.

            <p class="mbn-text">
                If your baby needs their bottle <a href="#10.1.4">warmed</a>, stand the bottle in a container of warm water or warm the water first before adding the formula (if you're making it up). Just make sure you avoid using microwaves to warm bottles as heating isn't always even and can cause 'hot spots' that can burn your baby's mouth and tongue.

                    <li>taking away their baby's bottle is denying their child of food and drink

               Because babies who continue using bottles after 12 months of age tend to do so more for <i>habit</i> or <i>calming</i> reasons rather than because they're hungry, they often drink more milk than they actually need.

                    Constipation is when your baby's poo is hard and dry, and looks like marbles. If your baby seems to be putting a lot of effort into pooing, it doesn't always mean they are constipated. Can you flatten your baby's poo by squeezing between the folds of the nappy? If so, then they are not constipated.

            <p class="mbn-text">
                    Constipation is often directly related to the <a href="#10.1.4">concentration of feeds</a> which can become too concentrated if not <a href="#10.1.4">made up correctly</a>.

            <p class="mbn-text">
                    If your baby is constipated and you are having difficulty fixing the problem, it's best to speak to your GP or <a href="#8.1.4">maternal and child health nurse</a> for advice.

                <br>
                        There <i>are</i> a few differences between Pregnancy and formula feeding, but this doesn't mean formula is <i>bad</i> for your baby. However, with so many <a href="#10.1.2">different types of formula</a> on the market, it's important to know that not all of them are suitable for your baby and some could even be harmful to your baby's health.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                        As long as you <a href="#10.1.1">choose a formula</a> that is suitable, <a href="#10.1.4">practice good hygiene</a> and <a href="#10.1.4">prepare it correctly</a> (following the manufacturer's instructions closely), then formula feeding is just fine for your baby!

                        There is no evidence that formula will help your baby to settle or sleep, despite what you might hear!

            <p class="mbn-text">
                        In fact, <a href="#5.1.1">most babies</a> normally wake through the night for the first few months, regardless of whether they're breastfed, formula-fed, or both.

                        You can find more information on sleep patterns for babies of different ages in the <a href="#5.1.1">feed/sleep patterns section</a>, including how you can <a href="#5.1.13">help your baby (and you!) to sleep through the night</a> if they are older than 6 months.

                        Most formulas are made from cow's milk that has been treated to make it is suitable for babies. This is the only formula most babies will need, unless your GP or <a href="#8.1.4">maternal and child health nurse</a> advises you otherwise.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">

Cow's milk allergies and lactose intolerance need to be diagnosed by a GP or paediatrician; they may also refer you to a <a href="#8.1.5">dietitian</a> for guidance.

                <br>
                Most bottles and teat will be fine to use, however there are a few things to keep in mind.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                    <b>Bottles</b>
                    <br>
                    Plastic bottles don't break as easily as glass. Look for plastic bottles that are:
               <ul>
                    <li class="mbn-ol">BPA-free (free of harmful chemicals)
                    </li>

                    <b>Teats</b>
                    <br>
                    Teats can be made from latex (brown) or silicone (clear) - either is fine. Teats are graded according to the age of the baby, but this isn't based on anything scientific. Try teats with bigger or smaller holes until you find the one that suits your baby.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                    If a teat becomes cracked, throw it away immediately. Bacteria can grow in the cracks and this makes it unsafe for your baby to use.

                <b>Do I have to sterilise <i>every</i> time?</b>
                <br>
                        Your baby's immune system is developing, so it is very important that you <a href="#10.1.3">sterilise all feeding equipment</a> after each use until your baby reaches 12 months as tummy upsets can easily happen. Sterilising all feeding equipment can reduce the risk of this happening by killing any harmful bacteria.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                        Remember also to always throw away any formula left in the bottle after a feed, never store or reuse it. Bacteria can easily survive and multiply, which can make your baby sick.

                        <a href="#10.1.4">Good hygiene</a> is just as important as making sure all <a href="#10.1.3">feeding equipment is sterilised</a> properly when <a href="#10.1.4">preparing each feed</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                        This reduces the risk of harmful bacteria and other germs contaminating the feed. To reduce this risk even further, it is always best to only make up each feed <i>just</i> as your baby needs it.

                <b>When can I stop boiling fresh water for the feed?</b>
                <br>
                        Water heated to boiling point should always be used to make up formula until your baby reaches 12 months. This should be part of <a href="#10.1.4">good hygiene</a> and <a href="#10.1.3">sterilising</a> to reduce the risk of harmful bacteria and other germs contaminating your baby's feed.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                        Remember, your baby's immune system is still developing and tummy upsets can easily happen, so it's important to be hygienic.
