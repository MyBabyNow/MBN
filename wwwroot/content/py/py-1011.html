                <b>2 weeks</b>
                <br /> Now that your period is finished, one of your ovaries is preparing to release an egg.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Your ovaries are also producing lots of oestrogen, which starts off some important processes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>'fertile mucus'(often like egg-white) is produced in your fallopian tubes and cervix - this helps protect any sperm along its way
                </li>
                <li>your uterus starts growing endometrium, a new lining, to nurture a fertilised egg
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mbn-text">
                By the end of this week, ovulation - the release of an egg from one of your ovaries - will happen.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="images/pregnancy-w2.jpg" class="mbn-text-image" />

            <p class="mbn-text">
                If you have a 28-day menstrual cycle, ovulation usually happens around day 14. Having sex 1-3 days <i>before</i> ovulation (or around days 11-13 of your 28-day cycle) will make it more likely you will fall pregnant.

                <b>3 weeks</b>
                <br /> After ovulation, the egg (sometimes two, which, if fertilised, will become non-identical, or fraternal, twins) travels toward your uterus along your fallopian tube. If you've had sex, sperm will also be moving upwards through your cervix towards your uterus.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                A sperm must burrow through the outer layers of your egg into the middle for conception to occur. This usually happens while your egg is still in the fallopian tube. If this happens, <b>you're pregnant</b>.
            </p>

            <p class="mbn-text">
                The level of progesterone in your blood will now increase. This lets your body know you're pregnant and causes the endometrium to boost its nutrient supply, which prevents your next period from happening.

                <br /> The fertilised egg will continue along your fallopian tube to your uterus and implant itself into the endometrium - this can take 3-10 days. Some women experience a small amount of bleeding (spotting) around the time of implantation.

            <p class="mbn-text">

                <i><b>Your baby</b></i>
                <br /> As soon as conception occurs, the blastocyst (fertilised egg) starts dividing. By the end of this week, it's already become a ball of about 200 cells and is about 4-5mm across.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Inside there are three layers forming, each of which will make up a unique part of your baby's body:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> <i>ectoderm</i> - nervous system, brain, skin and hair
                </li>
                <li> <i>endoderm</i> - gut and other internal organs
                </li>
                <li> <i>mesoderm</i> - skeleton, muscles and blood systems
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mbn-text">
                The outside of the blastocyst divides into two parts which form critical support structures for your growing baby:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><i>outside part</i> - sends out chorionic villi (little tentacles) which bury into the endometrium and will develop into the placenta
                </li>
                <li><i>inside part</i> - becomes the amniotic sac - the bubble filled with fluid which protects the growing embryo
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mbn-text">
                If, during the very early stage of the cell division process, the fertilised egg divides into two and starts forming two babies, identical (or monozygotic) twins will form. They are both from the same egg and same sperm, so have the same genes and will be the same gender.

                <u>Being induced</u>
                <br /> For most woman, <a onclick="localSecJump('10.1.1cw');">labour</a> starts naturally around <a onclick="localSecJump('10.1.1dl');">37</a>-<a onclick="localSecJump('10.1.1dz');">42 weeks</a>. If you're worried that your baby <a onclick="localSecJump('10.1.1dz');">could be overdue,</a>, it might be worth asking your midwife or GP how you can help to get your labour started.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                It's also worth asking about <a href="http://raisingchildren.net.au/articles/overdue_baby.html" target="_blank">induction of labour</a>, for example:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>when it might be recommended and why
                </li>
                <li>what it involves and if there are any risks or benefits for you and your baby
                </li>
                <li>what might happen if you decide against being induced and wait for labour to start naturally instead
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mbn-text" id="10.1.1dw">
                <u>Do you know how you are getting to the hospital or birth centre?</u>
                <br /> Unless you're having a homebirth, you'll need to make your own way to the hospital or birth centre.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Having a plan for how you'll get there, including things like making sure there's petrol in the car, knowing how to get there, where exactly to go (and park!), and who will babysit your other children (if you have any) can take off some unwanted pressure when the time comes.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                If at any stage, you're worried about your health or your baby's, or if your labour is happening too fast, you can always call an ambulance on 000 - just remember that you will be billed for the trip if you're not an ambulance member.

                <b>41+ weeks</b>
                <br /> If your pregnancy goes for longer than 41&frac12;- 42 weeks, your baby is overdue and your health professionals may recommend that your baby <a onclick="localSecJump('10.1.1dv');">be induced</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Just keep in mind that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>even though you have passed your 'due date', this date might have been calculated incorrectly early in your pregnancy and your baby might not <i>actually</i> be overdue
                </li>
                <li>sometimes, going past your due date can run in families or is more likely if you've had other pregnancies last longer than 40 weeks
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mbn-text">
                It's very likely that your baby is still going well, even if you're <a onclick="localSecJump('parents/parents-731.html#7.1.3c');">exhausted</a>, uncomfortable and ready to <a onclick="localSecJump('py-1013.html#10.1.3l');">meet your baby</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                If your baby is <i>definitely</i> overdue, an ultrasound might show that the placenta isn't working as well as before or there might be other concerns about your, or your baby's, health. Depending on your situation, your GP or midwife might recommend an <a onclick="localSecJump('10.1.1dv');">induction of labour</a> or having a caesarean.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Whatever the case, it's important that you understand the risk and benefits of any procedures suggested, including doing nothing and waiting for labour to start naturally. Make sure you ask lots of questions so you can make an informed decision.
