                What you eat and drink is vital to your overall health and wellbeing. Whilst eating healthily is important for everyone, it becomes even more so when you're pregnant (and when you are trying to conceive), influencing both your own wellbeing as well as that of your developing baby. For example, eating <a onclick="localSecJump('parents/parents-714.html#7.1.4l');">discretionary or 'sometimes' foods</a> (often called junk foods), such as those high in fat and sugar, can <a onclick="localSecJump('py-1013.html#10.1.3q');">cause your unborn baby to develop a preference 
                for these foods</a> during childhood and later life.

            <p class="mbn-text">
                Healthy eating during pregnancy doesn't have to be hard! It often just means changing the <a onclick="localSecJump('10.1.2e');">amount of different foods</a> you eat so that your diet is varied and nutritious.

                Because well-meaning advice from friends and family (and the internet) can often be conflicting and confusing, let's deal with a couple of the common myths first.
            </p>

            <p class="mbn-text" id="10.1.2c">
                <b>Common myths debunked</b>
                <br>
                <i><u>Myth:</u>  you need to be 'eating for two'</i>
                <br>
                <i><u>Truth:</u>  there is no need to 'eat for two'</i>
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Pregnant or not, you've no doubt heard of this one before! The reality is that the amount of food you need depends on many things, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>your weight before you became pregnant
                </li>
                <li>how far along you are with your pregnancy
                </li>
                <li>how active you are
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mbn-text">
                The <i>type</i> of food you eat throughout your pregnancy, not the <i>amount</i>, is far more important. For example, you should be eating the same amount of food during the first trimester of your pregnancy as you were before you were pregnant. You may need to eat slightly more during your second and third trimesters, such as an extra piece of fruit per day, but again, this depends on where you are with your pregnancy and how active you are.

                <img src="images/Alcohol and pregnancy.png" class="mbn-text-image mbn-text-image-left" /> It is best not to combine alcohol with pregnancy. This includes if you are trying to conceive - it's safest not to drink any alcohol at all. In fact, your partner should also limit his alcohol intake as drinking more than two
                <a href="http://www.alcohol.gov.au/internet/alcohol/publishing.nsf/Content/E9E12B0E00E94FD5CA25718E0081F1DC/$File/std0910.pdf" target="_blank">standard drinks</a> per day can affect his fertility too, reducing the chance of a healthy pregnancy.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                <img src="images/Alcohol and Pregnancy 2.png" class="mbn-text-image mbn-text-image-right" /> It's safest not to drink any alcohol when pregnant because it can pass through the placenta and into the bloodstream of your developing baby. This can affect the development of your baby's brain and increases your risk of miscarriage and premature birth. In severe cases, drinking alcohol when you're pregnant can cause foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD),
                <img src="images/Alcohol in pregnancy 3.png" class="mbn-text-image mbn-text-image-left" /> affecting the physical and mental characteristics of your baby as well as their behaviour. Even small amounts of alcohol during pregnancy can lead to problems with your baby's learning, emotional and social development.

                Not being able to drink alcohol due to <img src="images/Alcohol in pregnancy 4.png" class="mbn-text-image-right" /> pregnancy affects different people in different ways. How it affects <i>you</i> will depend on how much of a role alcohol normally plays in your life. For example, if alcohol is the way you unwind or manage stress, it's important to look for other ways to <a onclick="localSecJump('parents/parents-716.html#7.1.6n');"> relax or treat yourself</a>. <a onclick="localSecJump('10.1.2b');"> Eating healthily</a> and <a onclick="localSecJump('10.1.2w');">getting active</a> can also help to unwind, so unless your GP or midwife have advised you otherwise, try to get in about 30 minutes of moderate exercise on most days of the week, even if you were not active before your pregnancy.
            </p>

            <p class="mbn-text">
                There's certainly no need to feel like you are missing out, even when out! <img src="images/Alcohol in pregnancy 5.png" class="mbn-text-image-left" /> Opt for non-alcoholic drinks like water, milk, herbal teas, mocktails (e.g. lime and soda instead of vodka, lime and soda) as well as non-alcoholic wines and beers, which are becoming more commonly available. Just remember to watch for added sugars in mocktails (cordials, soft drinks etc) and to always check the label on non-alcoholic drinks as some will still contain small amounts of alcohol.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Cutting down or stopping alcohol can be hard if it is a big part of your life but it is best for your health and your baby's. You can always speak with your GP or <a onclick="localSecJump('hs/hs-812.html#8.1.2a');">midwife</a> about cutting back on alcohol and don't forget that there is <a onclick="localSecJump('hs/hs-818.html#8.1.8k');"><i>always</i> someone to talk to and plenty of other support available</a> if you need it, so don't be afraid to reach out!

                The amount of weight you should put on during your pregnancy depends on if you have a single or multiple pregnancies (e.g. twins) and what your <a href="tool:bmi calculator">body mass index (BMI)</a> was before you were pregnant. This is calculated by dividing your weight (kg) by your height (m) squared - <a href="tool:bmi calculator">use our BMI calculator</a>.

                As a rule of thumb, the higher your pre-pregnancy BMI, the less weight you will need to gain during your pregnancy as your body will already have enough energy (kilojoules/calories) stored for your pregnancy and then <a onclick="localSecJump('py-1013.html#10.1.3a');">breastfeeding</a>.

If you plan on having another baby, try to make sure you are at a healthy weight first - this will not only assist with being able to conceive, it will also give your new pregnancy the best possible starting point.
