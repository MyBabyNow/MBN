                <b>Breastfeeding is a learned skill</b>
                <br /> Because breastfeeding is so natural, you'd be forgiven for thinking that as soon as your baby is born and placed near your breast, it will all just happen and that's that.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                But, the reality is that just like riding a bike or playing a musical instrument, breastfeeding is a skill that we must <i>learn</i> in order to do it successfully. In fact, it can take a mum and her baby 6-8 weeks to figure out what works best for them!
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                It's quite common to find breastfeeding hard but it is also important to persist - the majority of problems can be overcome and there is no need to feel like a failure and give up. There's also no need to worry if <a onclick="localSecJump('py-1015.html#10.1.5m');">your own mum was unable to breastfeed</a> - it's not genetic, so there's no reason you won't be able to.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Many new mums also don't realise that there is <a onclick="localSecJump('hs/hs-815.html#8.1.5d');">plenty of support available</a> (much of it free) to help them breastfeed their baby - which is hardly surprising given that breastmilk is the only food that a new baby needs until they're around 6 months old!

                There are many benefits to breastfeeding, and not just for you and your baby!
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text" id="10.1.3d">
                Breastfeeding can <b>help you and your partner:</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><u>save money and time</u> - you don't need to <i>buy</i> breastmilk, so it's far cheaper than using formula (a single tin of formula costs around $25 and once open, must be used within a month), and because breastmilk is always clean, warm and ready, it's also far more convenient. As an added bonus, you won't need to sterilise bottles and teats, boil water or mix formula and, there is much less washing up!
                </li>
                <li><u>get more sleep</u> - mums who breastfeed tend to get back to sleep more quickly and easily than mums who bottle feed (and there's no need for someone to spend time warming up the milk!).
                </li>
                <li><u>with changing nappies</u> - your baby's poo should be softer and easier to clean up (and not as smelly).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mbn-text" id="10.1.3e">
                It can also <b>help you</b> to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><u>bond with your baby</u> - the <a onclick="localSecJump('10.1.3m');">skin-to-skin contact</a> gives you a physical connection with your baby and enhances bonding and attachment.
                </li>
                <li><u>recover after pregnancy</u> - the hormones produced when you breastfeed help to contract your uterus back down to its pre-pregnant size and shape within a few weeks after you give birth, reducing the chances of excessive bleeding after delivery.
                </li>
                <li><u>lose weight</u> - making breastmilk uses lots of energy (kilojoules/calories) so it helps you to lose excess <a onclick="localSecJump('py-1012.html#10.1.2ah');">weight you may have gained during pregnancy</a>.
                </li>
                <li><u>lower your risk of illness later in life</u> - breastfeeding lowers your risk of developing certain cancers (including breast and ovarian), osteoporosis and type 2 diabetes.
                </li>
            </ul>

                <b>Your baby benefits</b> from breastfeeding because:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><u>breastmilk is their perfect food</u> - it is easily digested, contains all the fluid, energy and nutrition they need until they're around 6 months old and, as they grow, it continues to change to meet all their nutritional needs.
                </li>
                <li><u>it boosts their immune system</u> - breastmilk contains a special blend of antibodies that helps protect your baby from illnesses such as gastroenteritis, chest infections, ear infections and urine infections. Eczema, asthma, obesity and type 1 diabetes are all less likely in babies who are breastfed.
                </li>
                <li><u>it protects against sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI)</u> - the risk of dying from SUDI reduces by more than 50% in babies who are breastfed.
                </li>
                <li><u>it promotes emotional security and brain development</u> - the bonding and attachment of <a onclick="localSecJump('10.1.3m');">skin-to-skin contact</a> with you is comforting and nurturing for your baby and even enhances their childhood independence, whilst your breastmilk also contains important fatty acids that help to develop your baby's brain.

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><u>it's environmentally friendly</u> - breastmilk needs far fewer natural resources to make and produces no waste.
                </li>
                <li><u>breastfed babies are healthier</u> - they are less likely to need medical attention which reduces the cost to governments, insurers and healthcare services. It also means families can spend more time at work instead of taking sick days to look after sick children.

                <img src="images/1013h-sqr.jpg" class="mbn-text-image-right" />
                <br /> During pregnancy, your breasts will develop in preparation for breastfeeding and will begin storing colostrum or 'first milk', which will be ready for your baby to drink at birth. Colostrum is your baby's perfect first food.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Colostrum is:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><u>thick, sticky and golden yellow in colour</u>
                </li>
                <li><u>rich in protein and secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA)</u> - an antibody which takes over from the antibody that protects your baby via their blood circulation during pregnancy (IgG). IgA boosts your baby's immune system by lining the mucous membranes in their throat, lungs and intestines (which are very leaky) with a barrier that stops most foreign substances from being absorbed.
                </li>
                <li><u>high in white blood cells</u> - to help defend your baby against bacteria and viruses.
                </li>
                <li><u>easy for your baby to digest</u>
                </li>
                <li>made in <u>very small quantities</u> - your newborn baby's tummy is only the size of a marble!

            <p class="mbn-text">
                Because your baby's <a onclick="localSecJump('bf/bf-111.html#1.1.1c');">tummy is so small</a> when they are first born, it's important to <a onclick="localSecJump('10.1.3t');">keep feeding them small amounts, often</a>. This ensures they get all the nutrition they need. Feeding frequently also stimulates your breasts to make more milk and <a onclick="localSecJump('10.1.3k');">set up your milk supply</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text" id="10.1.3j">
                <b>When breastmilk comes in</b>
                <br /> Between days 3-5, <a onclick="localSecJump('10.1.3i');">colostrum</a> will start to transition into mature breastmilk, a process that continues until two weeks after birth. The quantity increases rapidly, and the milk becomes less sticky and changes to a more white or opaque colour. You may even notice that at around days 3-5 your breasts will suddenly become very full and firm!
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                As your breasts increase the amount of milk they make, your baby keeps growing, as does their tummy. By days 3-5 your baby's tummy should be the size of a golf ball <img src="images/10.1.3j golf ball.png" class="mbn-text-image" /> but by day 10, it will have reached the size of a chicken egg! <img src="images/10.1.3j egg.png" class="mbn-text-image" />

            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text" id="10.1.3k">
                <b>Milk supply</b>
                <br /> By suckling at your breasts, your baby sends powerful messages to your body to make more milk ready for their next feed. This is controlled by two main hormones - prolactin and oxytocin - which are released into your bloodstream when your baby stimulates the nerve endings in your nipples by sucking.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Prolactin helps to make milk and build your supply while oxytocin makes the milk to spurt into your baby's mouth - known as the let-down reflex. The more often you have a let-down reflex and the more milk that is removed from your breasts, the more milk will be made.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Provided you feed your baby when <a onclick="localSecJump('sfp/sfp-514.html#5.1.4');">they're hungry</a>, they are <a onclick="localSecJump('10.1.3w');">attached on properly</a> and you let them feed for as long as they need to feed, your body will adapt to providing just what your baby needs.

            <p class="mbn-text">
                It <i>is</i> worth keeping in mind that your milk supply can take <a onclick="localSecJump('10.1.3u');">around 6 weeks to establish</a> and if anything interrupts this process, it might start to decrease, so it's best to avoid:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>trying to feed by the clock instead of when your baby <a onclick="localSecJump('sfp/sfp-514.html#5.1.4');">is hungry</a>
                </li>
                <li>giving formula or water instead of a breastfeed
                </li>
                <li>limiting the length or frequency of feeds in any way
                </li>
                <li>giving your baby <a onclick="localSecJump('10.1.3z');">a dummy or teat</a> to suck instead of a breastfeed
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                It's also a good idea not to schedule any major jobs for the first 6-8 weeks so you can just <a onclick="localSecJump('parents/parents-713.html#7.1.3c');">rest</a>, <a onclick="localSecJump('10.1.3u');">breastfeed</a> and enjoy your baby.

            <ul>
                <li>maintain healthy body temperature

            <p class="mbn-text">
                Skin-to-skin contact also ensures that your baby feels secure and <a onclick="localSecJump('10.1.3k');">stimulates hormones</a> that help to start breastfeeding, in both you and your baby, so your baby can begin to breastfeed as soon as they're ready.

            <p class="mbn-text">
                Before your baby is born, it's a good idea to ask your <a onclick="localSecJump('hs/hs-812.html#8.1.2a');">midwife</a> or obstetrician if they support immediate skin-to-skin contact with your baby after birth. If they don't (and immediate skin-to-skin contact with your baby is something that you would like) this gives you some time to discuss this further with them and emphasise its importance to you.

                <u>Hearing</u>
                <br /> By <a onclick="localSecJump('py-1011.html#10.1.1bg');">20 weeks of pregnancy</a>, your unborn baby can hear all sorts of sounds - your voice, heartbeat and digestion noises, as well as the music you listen to. In fact, newborn babies can usually recognise music they heard frequently when they were still in the womb!
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Music and stories are a great way to start connecting with your baby during pregnancy. Mums are lucky because their baby will hear them all day long but your partner and other family members who will be around your baby after birth can also bond by talking and singing to your belly regularly. It doesn't have to be anything special - even talking about the football or cricket is fine - it all helps your baby to get to know the sound of your voices!
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text" id="10.1.3q">
                <u>Taste</u>
                <br /> By the second trimester of pregnancy, your baby can taste your individual body odours and even taste some of the flavours of your diet through the amniotic fluid they're swallowing in utero. <a onclick="localSecJump('py-1012.html#10.1.2d');">Eating healthily</a> during your pregnancy and including lots of <a onclick="localSecJump('py-1012.html#10.1.2g');">vegetables</a> and <a onclick="localSecJump('py-1012.html#10.1.2h');">fruit</a> in your diet, will help your baby get used to these foods.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Once born, your baby will be drawn to the sweetish flavour of your breastmilk and it, along with your sweat, will remind your baby of the tastes they experienced in the womb.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text" id="10.1.3r">
                <u>Smell</u>
                <br /> Your baby's sense of smell is very sharp at birth so your individual odour should be very familiar! To strengthen this attachment, many women avoid wearing strong perfumes or using strong smelling soaps after giving birth.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text" id="10.1.3s">
                <u>Touch</u>
                <br /> In late pregnancy, your baby is tucked up snuggly inside your uterus so you can imagine how, at birth, your baby may suddenly feel insecure when there is suddenly so much room in this bright and cold atmosphere for their arms and legs to flail about! Holding your baby <a onclick="localSecJump('10.1.3m');">skin-to-skin</a> helps them to feel safe again.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Being held securely, tasting and smelling the familiarity of your body, hearing your voice and focussing on your face, helps your baby to slowly adapt to the world. If you're not able to do this immediately, being held <a onclick="localSecJump('10.1.3m');">skin-to-skin</a> by your partner or just <a onclick="localSecJump('sfp/sfp-517.html#5.1.7c');">being swaddled</a>, are other ways you can help your baby to feel secure.

                Many women find that if they invest time in their <a onclick="localSecJump('parents/parents-716.html#7.1.6a');">new role as a mum</a> and plan nothing else for the first couple of months, transition to motherhood goes more smoothly.

            <ul>
                <li>building a house or putting in an extension (unless you can move out)

                <li>taking on large or stressful projects like planning a wedding or sorting out your finances

                <li>things that require sticking to a schedule - haircuts, dentist appointments, manicures etc - try to do these routine things <i>before</i> you give birth because life with a new baby can be unpredictable!

            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                The main thing is that your baby needs to be positioned chest-to-chest with you, so they don't have to turn their neck to suck. Your baby's head also needs to be gently extended so they can drink freely.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                A good motto to remember is <i>'chest-to-chest, nose-to-nipple'</i>.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Some of the most popular feeding positions are:

            <ul>
                <li>the cradle hold

                Your baby may produce a few soft poos or bowel movements every day, although fully breastfed babies might only poo every few days - it varies quite a bit. As the week goes by, your baby's poos should begin to change:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>day 1: black, thick and sticky 'meconium'
                </li>
                <li>days 2-3: gradually getting less sticky and brown/greenish
                </li>
                <li>days 3-5 onwards: soft and runny pale yellow or yellowish-brown mustard-coloured poos

                <b>Normal newborn weight changes</b>
                <br /> After you have had <a onclick="localSecJump('10.1.3m');">skin-to-skin contact</a> and the first breastfeed on the day your baby is born, your midwife will offer to <a onclick="localSecJump('sfp/sfp-515.html#5.1.5');">weigh your baby</a> to record their birth weight. It is normal for babies to lose up to 10% of their birth weight in the first few days but they usually regain their birth weight again by week 2-3.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Knowing your baby's birth weight is a good way to <a onclick="localSecJump('sfp/sfp-515.html#5.1.5');">monitor their growth and weight gain</a>, and therefore that they're feeding well. If your baby loses more than 10% of their birth weight or is not tracking well on the <a onclick="localSecJump('sfp/sfp-515.html#5.1.5');">growth chart</a>, your <a onclick="localSecJump('hs/hs-812.html#8.1.2a');">midwife</a> may give you individualised feeding advice.

                <b>Rooming-in</b>
                <br /> For the first 6-12 months, it is recommended to keep your baby in a cot in your room as this has been shown to <a onclick="localSecJump('sfp/sfp-5115.html#5.1.15');">reduce the risk of sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI), including SIDS</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Also called 'rooming-in', keeping your baby in your room with you all the time will help you get to know your baby quickly. You will start to recognise their unique facial expressions, sounds and body movements which will help you to understand what they're trying to communicate, for example, are they <a onclick="localSecJump('sfp/sfp-514.html#5.1.4');">hungry</a> or <a onclick="localSecJump('sfp/sfp-516.html#5.1.6');">tired</a>?
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Rooming-in allows you to respond to your baby appropriately and to breastfeed them whenever they are hungry. This is one of the reasons that rooming-in makes breastfeeding easier and helps you to build and maintain your <a onclick="localSecJump('10.1.3k');">milk supply</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Babies who room-in with their mums tend to:

            <ul>
                <li>cry less
                </li>
                <li>settle more quickly (which means more sleep for you!)

                <li>take in more breastmilk
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Not surprisingly, rooming-in is now standard in almost all hospitals and birth centres in Australia for mums and healthy term babies.
