					<b>Benefits of physical activity</b>
					<br />
					Just as with <a href="#7.1.4">eating healthily</a>, regular physical activity is important for everyone and brings with it many
                    health benefits. Being physically active also sets a good example for your baby, so don't forget to make time each day to <a href="#play">
                    play with your baby</a>! 
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text" id="7.1.5c">
					Physical activity, in the short-term can:

                    <ul>
                        <li>improve sleep and sleep quality
                        </li>
                        <li>boost your mood and wellbeing (especially if you're feeling down or anxious)
                        </li>
                        <li>increase your energy levels                       
                        </li>
                        <li>be a chance to meet up with others (e.g. friends, family, mothers' group)
                        </li>
                        <li>promote healthy habits as 'normal to your baby
                        </li>
                    </ul>
				</p>   
				<p class="mbn-text" id="7.1.5d">
					In the longer term, regular physical activity can:

                    <ul>
                        <li>reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke
                        </li>
                        <li>help keep your weight, cholesterol and blood pressure in check
                        </li>
                        <li>decrease your risk of developing type 2 diabetes (which is particularly important if you had gestational diabetes when pregnant)     
                        </li>
                        <li>strengthen your bones

				<p class="mbn-text" id="7.1.5e">
					Regularly keeping active will not only leave you feeling great but also means your baby has a better chance of having healthier
                    parents for longer!
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text" id="7.1.5f">
					<b>When to start</b>
					<br />
					Before you start any physical activity, it's always a good idea to check with your GP or <a href="#8.1.2">maternal and child health
                    nurse</a> for specific advice.
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text">
					If you've just given birth, you should be able to start some gentle physical activity (such as walking) soon after childbirth but
                    the main thing is that whatever you do feels comfortable for you. Start off slowly and then gradually increase how hard you go
                    and for how long as you feel more able.
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text">
					If you had a caesarean birth, it is best to avoid vigorous physical activity (e.g. running) for at least 6 weeks to give your body a
                    chance to heal properly. Again, it's a good idea to talk with your GP or <a href="#8.1.2">maternal and child health nurse</a> if you
                    are concerned or have any questions.
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text" id="7.1.5g">
					<b>How much should you do?</b>
					<br />
					As a new parent, being physically active on a regular basis can be hard - life is unpredictable and you might find it difficult. 
                    This is normal! Knowing what is recommended though can be a useful goal to work towards in the future. 
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text" id="7.1.5h">
					All adults should aim to be physically active on most (preferably all) days of the week.
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text">
					Over one week, this could be:
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>150-300 minutes (2.5-5 hours) of moderate intensity physical activity (e.g. walking, cycling or swimming) <B>OR</B>
                        </li>
                        <li>75-150 minutes (1.25-2.5 hours) of vigorous intensity physical activity (e.g. running hard enough to be out of breath) <B>OR</B>
                        </li>
                        <li>a combination of both moderate and vigorous activities that are equivalent
                        </li>
                    </ul>
				</p>   
				<p class="mbn-text" id="7.1.5i">
					<b>Tips for getting active</b>
					<br />
					Walking is great for everyone, especially new mums - it is free, low impact, can be done any time, with or without friends
                    and at your own pace. Walking has many health benefits and if you can squeeze in half an hour each day (at a pace which makes you 
                    slightly out of breath) you can improve your daily health and wellbeing as well as your long-term health.
				<p class="mbn-text">
					If you're into running (or would like to start) you might like to look into getting a pram that you can safely run with. This is a
                    great way to get some vigorous physical activity whilst getting out and about with your baby. It's also a chance for your partner
                    to have some 'me' time if they don't want to join you.
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text">
					There are many other ways to include more physical activity in your day - see below for some more ideas!
