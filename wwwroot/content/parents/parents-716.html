            <p class="mbn-text">
                Compared to the time you had before you had a baby, you will probably also find you have less time to socialise. Spending a lot more time at home might leave you feeling confined to the house but it is important that you don't feel isolated.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Ways to stay in touch with the outside world could be:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>calling a friend or family member

                Don't worry or feel ashamed if you don't feel an instant connection with your baby - this is perfectly normal!
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                You might have been expecting to have an all-encompassing wave of unconditional love when your baby first arrived, but it <i>takes</i> time to form this bond as you get to know each other, just like with any other new relationship.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Many mums find that feeding time also doubles as good bonding time with their new baby. This is because the distance from your breast to your face lets your baby focus on your face (which is why it's often called the 'cuddle distance'). Talking to your baby as you <a onclick="localSecJump('bf/bf-111.html##1.1.1a');">breastfeed</a> them allows your baby to make the connection between your face and your voice which will be so familiar from the womb.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Outside of feeding there are a <a onclick="localSecJump('bf/bf-119.html##1.1.9f');">plenty of other ways to bond with your baby</a>, which can be great for partners, especially if mum is doing all the feeding. Non-feeding bonding also teaches your baby that love does not have to involve the giving of food!

            <p class="mbn-text">
                Even though it's quite clear who mum is, it can take some time to fall into new roles. This can be especially true if mum was previously invested in full-time work and is now at home with the baby. It might also be the case that mum's partner wants to be a more involved parent, but current commitments (such as work and commuting) don't leave much time for helping with the baby.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Ensuring you think about and discuss with your partner what each of your roles are, both inside and outside the home, is important for your own wellbeing, relationship and your baby's home environment.

                Just like any new role you take on, becoming a parent might feel a bit overwhelming! It takes time to adjust to your new role within the family unit but the best way to do this, is to just get in and have a go, at everything you can.

                Although only mum can <a onclick="localSecJump('bf/bf-111.html#1.1.1a');">breastfeed</a> your baby, both parents are just as good as each other at recognising and responding to the needs of their babies and children.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Feeding aside, there are many other ways partners can get involved and this means your baby will be exposed (and adapt) to different styles of parenting, which helps them learn social skills.

                Returning to (or starting) work

            <p class="mbn-text">
                Choosing to return to (or start) work can be a tough decision after having a baby. In addition to earning enough money to keep a family clothed, sheltered, and fed, many people feel 'complete' by having a job and for most this can also be a positive experience outside of caring for a child.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Making sure you are personally fulfilled now you've taken on the role as a parent is important, and if going to work will help, this can only be a positive thing for you, your baby and overall family.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text" id="7.1.6k">
                It's normal to have anxieties about returning to work. Should you decide to, there are many options for childcare - whether it be family support or childcare, it's important you feel comfortable with your decision.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text" id="7.1.6l">
                Children are extremely resilient and can not only cope with many different caring arrangements, they also enjoy new and challenging environments. Getting the right balance between time spent at home and time in childcare or with family can be difficult but as long you feel supported and comfortable with your childcare arrangements you shouldn't worry.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text" id="7.1.6m">
                If working at home is an option, you might like to discuss this with your employer. Although it may seem daunting, if you feel it would help make this adjustment period easier, it can't hurt. On the other hand, you might like the idea of keeping work and home life separate.

                <b>Ask for help!</b>
                <br />
                Most friends and family are looking for a way to help - letting them will take some of the pressure of you!
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Simple things they could help with include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>picking up food, groceries or other items you need when dropping by to visit
                </li>
                <li>preparing some of the week's meals - this could be something you do regularly (e.g. every Wednesday night)
                </li>
                <li>doing some of the housework, such as a weekly vacuum - the housework will <i>always</i> be there but spending time with your baby is more important
                </li>
                <li>looking after your baby so you can <a onclick="localSecJump('parents-716.html#7.1.6n');">do something for yourself for a couple of hours</a> - this could be at a set time each week
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mbn-text">
                Stay organised by:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>keeping <a onclick="localSecJump('parents-714.html#7.1.4');">easy, healthy foods</a> in the house such as canned beans or tuna, frozen vegetables, wholemeal pasta and brown rice - learn a <a onclick="localSecJump('recipe/recipe-611.html#6.1.1a');">few easy recipes</a> using these items so you're never stuck for meals
                </li>
                <li>saving time wherever you can - for example:
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>keep a shopping list on your mobile phone so you have it with you whenever you're out
                    </li>
                    <li>have a specific spot for your keys (and other items) so you always know where they are
                    </li>
                    <li>keep a nappy bag stocked with all the essentials so that you can leave the house more quickly
                    </li>
                    <li>order things you need online and have them delivered - including groceries
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <b>Still frustrated by not getting anything 'done'?</b>
                <br />
                Try prioritising just one thing you want to get done each day - this is a realistic aim while looking after a baby.
            </p>

                It's not necessarily going to be easy but it will be worth it - see how other parents reflect on the challenges, achievements, positives and negatives of being a parent.
