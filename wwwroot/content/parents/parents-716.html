                    adjust to your new life as a parent. 
				<p class="mbn-text">
					Mum's body has been through a lot but should start to heal quickly. Soon after birth it's best for mum to get as much

				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text" id="7.1.6e">
					<b>Connecting with others</b>
				    <br />
					Compared to the time you had before you had a baby, you will probably also find you have less time to socialise. Spending a 
                    lot more time at home might leave you feeling confined to the house but it is important that you don't feel isolated.  
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text">
					Ways to stay in touch with the outside world could be:
                    <ul>
                        <li>calling a friend or family member                  
                        </li>
                        <li>catching up with other new parents for a walk and coffee
                        </li>
                        <li>connecting with others through <a href="forum">our forum</a> and other social media
                        </li>
                    </ul>
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text" id="7.1.6f">
					<b>Bonding with your baby</b>
				    <br />
					Don't worry or feel ashamed if you don't feel an instant connection with your baby - this is perfectly normal!
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text">
					You might have been expecting to have an all-encompassing wave of unconditional love when your baby first arrived, but it <i>takes</i> 
                    time to form this bond as you get to know each other, just like with any other new relationship. 
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text">
					Many mums find that feeding time also doubles as good bonding time with their new baby. This is because the distance from your 
                    breast to your face lets your baby focus on your face (which is why it's often called the 'cuddle distance'). Talking to 
                    your baby as you  <a href="#1.1.1">breastfeed</a> them allows your baby to make the connection between your face and your voice 
                    which will be so familiar from the womb.
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text">
					Outside of feeding there are a  <a href="#1.1.9">plenty of other ways to bond with your baby</a>, which can be great for partners, 
                    especially if mum is doing all the feeding. Non-feeding bonding also teaches your baby that love does not have to involve 
                    the giving of food!
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text" id="7.1.6g">
					<b>Working out new roles</b>
				    <br />
					Even though it's quite clear who mum is, it can take some time to fall into new roles. This can be especially true if mum was 
                    previously invested in full-time work and is now at home with the baby. It might also be the case that mum's partner wants to be a 
                    more involved parent, but current commitments (such as work and commuting) don't leave much time for helping with the baby.
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text">
					Ensuring you think about and discuss with your partner what each of your roles are, both inside and outside the home, is important for 
                    your own wellbeing, relationship and your baby's home environment. 
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text">
					Things to consider include your financial and work situations, what tasks need doing at home and what makes you happy. See 
                    some <a href="http://raisingchildren.net.au/articles/becoming_a_dad.html#working ">more starting points for discussions</a> around parental

					<b>Parenting for partners</b>
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text">
					Just like any new role you take on, becoming a parent might feel a bit overwhelming! It takes time to adjust to your new role 
                    within the family unit but the best way to do this, is to just get in and have a go, at everything you can.  
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text">
					Although only mum can  <a href="#1.1.1">breastfeed</a> your baby, both parents are just as good as each other at recognising and 
                    responding to the needs of their babies and children.
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text">
					Feeding aside, there are many other ways partners can get involved and this means your baby will be exposed (and adapt) to different 
                    styles of parenting, which helps them learn social skills. 
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text">
					Some ways to get involved with your baby include  <a href="#play">making time to play</a>, having one-on-one time with your
                    baby,  <a href="#1.1.9">chatting to and showing your baby affection</a> and trying everything such as <a href="#5.1.8">settling</a>,

					<b>Returning to (or starting) work</b>
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text">
					Choosing to return to (or start) work can be a tough decision after having a baby. In addition to earning enough money to 
                    keep a family clothed, sheltered, and fed, many people feel 'complete' by having a job and for most this can also be a positive 
                    experience outside of caring for a child.  
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text">
					Making sure you are personally fulfilled now you've taken on the role as a parent is important, and if going to work will help, this 
                    can only be a positive thing for you, your baby and overall family. 
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text" id="7.1.6k">
					It's normal to have anxieties about returning to work. Should you decide to, there are many options for childcare - whether it be 
                    family support or childcare, it's important you feel comfortable with your decision.  
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text" id="7.1.6l">
					Children are extremely resilient and can not only cope with many different caring arrangements, they also enjoy new and
                    challenging environments. Getting the right balance between time spent at home and time in childcare or with family can be
                    difficult but as long you feel supported and comfortable with your childcare arrangements you shouldn't worry.
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text" id="7.1.6m">
					If working at home is an option, you might like to discuss this with your employer. Although it may seem daunting, if you feel it 
                    would help make this adjustment period easier, it can't hurt. On the other hand, you might like the idea of keeping work and 
                    home life separate.

				<p class="mbn-text" id="7.1.6o">
					Some ideas include:

					<b>Managing time</b>

                        <li>doing some of the housework, such as a weekly vacuum - the housework will <i>always</i> be there but spending time with your baby is more important

                        <li>looking after your baby so you can <a href="#7.1.6">do something for yourself for a couple of hours</a> - this could be at a set time each week
