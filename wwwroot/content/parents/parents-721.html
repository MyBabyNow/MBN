				<p class="mbn-text" id="7.1.2">
					Now your baby has finally arrived, it might feel like parenthood has only just begun, but the reality is you've probably already been
					through quite a lot to get to this point in your journey as a new
					parent. 
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text">    
					First there's the pregnancy and the rollercoaster of emotions, realisations and changes in lifestyle that go along with preparing
                    to welcome your baby into your life. If you've had difficult pregnancies before or have been trying to become a parent for a long
                    time, "hoping everything goes well <i>this</i> time around" is something else that might have played on your mind.  
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text">  
					There might also be uncertainties around your living arrangements, work and financial situations, potentially stressful relations
                    with friends and family members who 'know best', reflections on your ownupbringing and anxieties about how <i>you</i> will cope as a parent. 
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text">
					As the pregnancy progresses, getting a good night's sleep often gets harder for soon-to-be parents to achieve, especially if mum-to-be
                    is uncomfortable and tossing and turning! 
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text">
					All of this adds up to take its toll on you, both physically and mentally.When your baby arrives it's generally a pretty exciting
                    time. But you also probably <a href="#7.1.3">feel quite exhausted</a>, and that's before realising that you're suddenly a parent who
                    is responsible for looking after this little baby, which can feel a bit overwhelming. 
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text">
					This is all normal!

					<b>Postnatal depression</b>
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text">
					Most women tend to experience the 'baby blues'- having mixed emotions, crying and feeling anxious - especially around 3-5 days after
                    birth. However, for about 1 in every 7 women, these feelings candevelop into postnatal depression (PND).
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text">
					Even though most people think that it's <i>only women</i> who can experience PND, it's actually not that unusual
                    for <a href="http://raisingchildren.net.au/articles/men_and_postnatal_depression.html/context/1023#facts">men to experience PND</a> too. 
                    In fact, up to 1 in 10 men experience PND (often before their baby is born). Even though men with partners who have PND are more likely
                    to develop PND themselves, there are <a href="http://raisingchildren.net.au/articles/men_and_postnatal_depression.html/context/1023#factor">
                    many factors that can bring on PND</a>, even if their partner doesn't have PND herself. 
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text" id="7.1.2b">
					Symptoms of PND include: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>feeling out of control, unable to cope or stressed
                        </li>
                        <li>feeling irritable, anxious or angry
                        </li>
                        <li>crying often but for no apparent reason
                        </li>
                        <li>changes in appetite, memory or sleep patterns (especially a lack of sleep that is unrelated to your baby's needs)
                        </li>
                        <li> having obsessive negative thoughts
                        </li>
                        <li> fearing being alone or feelings of isolation or disconnection from loved ones
                        </li>
                        <li> withdrawing from intimate relationships and from family, friends and community activities (e.g. staying in all the time or spending long hours at work)
                        </li>
                        <li> having a low self-esteem, not feeling confident or feeling inadequate
                        </li>
                        <li> tiredness, pain and headaches
                        </li>
                    </ul>
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text">
					Some symptoms that are specific to men include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>a loss of libido
                        </li>
                        <li>taking more risks that normal
                        </li>
                        <li>drinking more alcohol or using more drugs than before (which can be a coping mechanism instead of seeking help) 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text">
					If you recognise any of the above symptoms, are worried or feel like the 'baby blues', low mood or anxiety has stayed with you
                    for longer than 1-2 weeks, it's important to seek help from your GP, <a href="#8.1.2">maternal and child health nurse</a> or 
                    <a href="#8.1.8">contact PANDA</a> for confidential information and support. 
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text">
					Asking for advice doesn't mean you <i>have</i> PND or that you're not coping, it just means you are looking out for yourself 
                    (and your baby) by being the best that you can be.

					Even if you've been feeling down, withdrawn, moody or teary, it doesn't necessarily mean you have PND. There are so many changes
                    related to becoming a parent that can have a big impact on how you're feeling. 
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text">
					Difficult recoveries, <a href="#7.1.3">lack of sleep</a>, <a href="#5.1.9">colicky babies</a> and even changes in your relationship
                    can all contribute to your mood. As a starting point to feeling better, try some of the following tips.
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text" id="7.1.2e">
					<b>Take a nap</b>
					<br />
					A lack of sleep is a big contributor to feeling tired and overwhelmed, so if you can manage a <a href="#7.1.3">quick nap</a> or even
                    a short break to rest from housework, work and other tasks such as cooking and cleaning, it can work wonders! Never be afraid
                    to <a href="#7.1.6">share the load</a> - ask a friend, family member, partner or neighbour to help you get some rest.                
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text" id="7.1.2f">
					<b>Time out is important!</b>
					<br />
					Try planning a night or afternoon out with friends, your partner or by yourself every once in a while - the interaction with others
                    and a change of scenery can help you feel good.

					Check out some <a href="#7.1.6">ideas for treating yourself</a>.
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text" id="7.1.2g">
					<b>Get active</b>
					<br />
					Doing <a href="#7.1.5">some physical activity</a> can be a great pick-me-up for new parents - it gives you time to think, 
                    brightens your mood and boosts your energy levels.
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text">
					Try to make physical activity a habit by setting aside a regular time each day or week to be active.
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text" id="7.1.2h">
					<b>Talk to other parents</b>
					<br />
					Having other new parents around can be a great support network - they will know exactly what you're going through and can probably
                    relate to how you're feeling. The great news is that there are lots of services in the community for parents, especially new parents!
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text">
					Try chatting to the mums in your mothers' group, join <a href="#Forum">our forum</a> to connect with other new parents and check 
                    out the <a href="#8.1">help and support section</a> to see what else is out there. 
				</p>
				<p class="mbn-text" id="7.1.2i">
					If you think you might have PND, don't worry: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>most people who get help early usually recover fully from PND
                        </li>
                        <li>speaking with your GP or <a href="#8.1.2">maternal and child health nurse</a> is the first step to diagnosing and treating PND
                            to help you feel more like yourself again - don't be afraid to bring this up with them!
                        </li>
                        <li>if you're not sure you're ready to speak with your GP just yet, you can always check out <a href="#8.1.8">contact PANDA</a> for
