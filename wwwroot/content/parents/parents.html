        <p class="mbn-text" id="7.1.1">
                Creating and giving birth to a baby takes its toll on a woman's body!
                And although you might wish to just get back to normal as much as
                possible, there are a couple of things that you should be aware of
                following childbirth, including when it's likely safe for mum to start
                getting physically active again. 
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text" id="7.1.1a">
            <b>Strengthening your pelvic floor</b>
            <br />
            </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                Your pelvic floor is a set of muscles that hold your bladder, uterus andbowel in place and give you control over your bladder and bowel.
                Although pregnancy and childbirth can weaken these muscles, you can help your pelvic floor recover by regularly doing the exercises that your midwife gave you during pregnancy.
        </p>   
                Unless you've been told otherwise, you can start doing pelvic floor strengthening exercises immediately after you've given birth - <a href="#8.1.2"> learn how to do them and ways to make them just another part of your day</a>.
        </p>
                Around 6 weeks after childbirth, your body will have more than likelyreturned to normal. If you are worried about your body or any changes you have noticed, it is best to speak to your GP or <a href="# 8.1.2"> maternal and child health nurse</a>. 
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text" id="7.1.1b"><b>Postpartum haemorrhoids (piles)</b>
            </p> 
        <p class="mbn-text">
                Postpartum haemorrhoids or 'piles' are common, especially when you've had a baby, but can be prevented by eating a healthy diet high in fibre to avoid constipation.
            </p> 
               <p class="mbn-text">
                High fibre foods to help prevent constipation include:  
                <ul>
                    <li> fruits and vegetables (with skins on)
                    </li>
                    <li> wholegrain foods (e.g. breads and cereals, brown rice)
                    </li>
                    <li> nuts, seeds and grains (e.g. almonds, linseeds, sunflower seeds)
                    </li>
                    <li> bran (e.g. wheat bran or rice bran)
                    </li>
                    <li> dried beans
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

        <p class="mbn-text">
                
                It's also important to stay hydrated to avoid constipation when you
                eat additional fibre. Be sure to drink enough fluid - ideally water - try to reach around 8 glasses a day (9 if you're pregnant or breastfeeding).

        <p class="mbn-text" id="7.1.1c"><b>Physical activity</b>
        </p> 
                Moderate or vigorous intensity physical activity will not affect your ability to breastfeed successfully but make sure you drink plenty of fluids, especially water, to avoid dehydration..
        </p> 
        <p class="mbn-text">
                If you had a caesarean birth, it is best to avoid vigorous physical activity (e.g. running) for at least 6 weeks so you can heal properly. If you are worried about this or have questions, make sure you talk with your GP or <a href="# 8.1.2">maternal and child health nurse</a>.
        </p>     
        <p class="mbn-text">
                Some tips: 
            <ul>
                    <li> wear a good sports bra for physical activity of a moderate to vigorous intensity (e.g. when you will be puffing hard)
                    </li>
                    <li> high impact physical activity (e.g. running or a gym class) is best done <i>after</i> breastfeeding because your breasts will be relatively empty (less full of breastmilk) which will reduce bounce and discomfort.

        <p class="mbn-text" id="7.1.2">
                Now your baby has finally arrived, it might feel like parenthood has
                only just begun, but the reality is you've probably already been
                through quite a lot to get to this point in your journey as a new
                parent. 
        </p>  
        <p class="mbn-text">    
                First there's the pregnancy and the rollercoaster of emotions, realisations and changes in lifestyle that go along with preparing to welcome your baby into your life. If you've had difficult pregnancies before or have been trying to become a parent for a long time,"hoping everything goes well <i>this</i> time around" is something else that might have played on your mind.  
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">  
                There might also be uncertainties around your living arrangements, work and financial situations, potentially stressful relations with friends and family members who 'know best', reflections on your ownupbringing and anxieties about how <i>you</i> will cope as a parent. 
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                As the pregnancy progresses, getting a good night's sleep often gets harder for soon-to-be parents to achieve, especially if mum-to-be is uncomfortable and tossing and turning!

        <p class="mbn-text">
                All of this adds up to take its toll on you, both physically and mentally.When your baby arrives it's generally a pretty exciting time.

                <b>Postnatal depression</b>
            </p> 
                <p class="mbn-text">
                Most women tend to experience the 'baby blues'- having mixed emotions, crying and feeling anxious - especially around 3-5 days after birth. However, for about 1 in every 7 women, these feelings candevelop into postnatal depression (PND).
            </p> 
                <p class="mbn-text">
                Even though most people think that it's <i>only women</i> who can experience PND, it's actually not that unusual for <a href="http://raisingchildren.net.au/articles/men_and_postnatal_depression.html/context/1023#facts">men to experience PND</a> too. In fact, up to 1 in 10 men experience PND (often before their baby is born). Even though men with partners who have PND are more likely to develop PND themselves, there are <a href="http://raisingchildren.net.au/articles/men_and_postnatal_depression.html/context/1023#factors
                ">many factors that can bring on PND</a>, even if their partner doesn't have PND herself. 
            </p> 
                  <p class="mbn-text" id="7.1.2b">
                Symptoms of PND include: 
                <ul>
                    <li>feeling out of control, unable to cope or stressed
                </li>
                    <li>feeling irritable, anxious or angry
                </li>
                    <li>crying often but for no apparent reason
                </li>
                    <li>changes in appetite, memory or sleep patterns (especially a lack of sleep that is unrelated to your baby's needs)
                </li>
                    <li> having obsessive negative thoughts
                </li>
                    <li> fearing being alone or feelings of isolation or disconnection from loved ones
                </li>
                    <li> withdrawing from intimate relationships and from family, friends and community activities (e.g. staying in all the time or spending long hours at work)
                </li>
                    <li> having a low self-esteem, not feeling confident or feeling inadequate
                </li>
                    <li> tiredness, pain and headaches
                </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                <p class="mbn-text">
                Some symptoms that are specific to men include:
                <ul>
                    <li>a loss of libido
                </li>
                    <li>taking more risks that normal
                </li>
                    <li>drinking more alcohol or using more drugs than before (which can be a coping mechanism instead of seeking help) 
                </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
                 <p class="mbn-text">
                 If you recognise any of the above symptoms, are worried or feel like the 'baby blues', low mood or anxiety has stayed with you for longer than 1-2 weeks, it's important to seek help from your GP, <a href="#8.1.2">maternal and child health nurse</a> or <a href="#8.1.8">contact PANDA</a> for confidential information and support.

                 Asking for advice doesn't mean you <i>have</i> PND or that you're not coping, it just means you are looking out for yourself (and your baby) by being the best that you can be.

                <b>Benefits of sleep</b>
                 <br />
                One of the biggest challenges of being a new parent is getting enough sleep! Adults generally need 7-8 hours of sleep per night but as a new parent, <a href="#5.1.8">your baby crying</a> and needing feeds throughout the night can make this near impossible!
            </p>
                <p class="mbn-text">
                It can be tempting to accept feeling tired as <i>normal</i> and to 'just get on with it' but getting enough sleep is just as important for you as it is for your baby.
            </p>  
                <p class="mbn-text" id="7.1.3b">
                 Some signs that you might need more sleep include:
                <ul>
                    <li>difficulty concentrating
                </li>
                    <li>feeling down or being moody
                </li>
                    <li>feeling anxious
                </li>
                    <li>problems with coordination or being more clumsy than normal
                </li>                   
                </ul>
            </p>
                 <p class="mbn-text">
                Getting enough sleep can help you feel happier and calmer. It can also help you more fully enjoy the experience of being a new parent, which in turn will help your baby feel more relaxed.
            </p>  
                 <p class="mbn-text">
              Not getting enough sleep also adds up, so if you feel tired or notice any of the above signs, try to prioritise getting more sleep.

                 <b>Sleep tips</b>
                  <br />
                 Although your old sleeping patterns may no longer be possible, there are a number of ways to make sure you still get enough sleep. It's even possible to <a href="#1.1.16">manage enough sleep when you're breastfeeding</a>!
            </p>  
                <p class="mbn-text" id="7.1.3d">
                 <b>Take naps</b>
                  <br />
                 Napping can be a great way to increase the amount of sleep you get, especially during early weeks and months when you may be waking often at night to feed your baby.               
             </p>
                 <p class="mbn-text">
                A nap should last no longer than 15-30 minutes. Any longer and your body may think it has had enough sleep and stop you from sleeping well at night.

                <ul>

                    </li>
                    <li>having a nap or a rest when your baby sleeps
                    </li>
                    <li>setting an alarm to make sure you don't nap for longer than 30 minutes

                  <br />
                 Caffeine can make you feel good in the short term but can make sleeping and resting harder. Keep in mind that if you're breastfeeding, any caffeine you consume also <a href="#1.1.14">passes into your breastmilk</a> and can upset your baby. 
             </p>
                 <p class="mbn-text">
                Because caffeine stays in your system for more than 6 hours, it's best to avoid heavily caffeinated drinks (such as coffee, colas and tea) late in the afternoon and evening when they are more likely to interfere with your sleep patterns.
            </p>

                 <p class="mbn-text">
                    You are your baby's most important role model and food is no exception.

                  <p class="mbn-text">
                    Because your baby is always watching you (and trying to copy what you do), your own eating habits, and the foods you have at home, actually have a big influence on the foods that your baby learns to like and therefore eats, even if you try to teach them otherwise.
            </p>  
                    <p class="mbn-text">
                    Let's use broccoli as an example. 
            </p>
                 <p class="mbn-text">
                    If your baby sees you enjoying broccoli when you eat it, they are more likely to learn to enjoy broccoli (when they start solids) as well.
            </p>  
                    <p class="mbn-text">
                    But if they see you pulling broccoli out of a stir-fry, leaving it on the side of your plate and screwing your nose up at it (because you don't like it) this is what they'll think is 'normal' behaviour towards broccoli.  
            </p>  
                    <p class="mbn-text">
                    Even if they have never tasted broccoli, they'll be more likely to dislike it because they have seen you avoiding it, which is a problem because it already <a href="#4.1.11">takes some time for some children to like vegetables</a>.  
            </p>  
                    <p class="mbn-text">
                    The same is true of <a href="#4.1.8">meal times</a> - whatever is normal in your household (e.g. sitting on the couch watching TV, the family gathered around the table together, or everyone just grazing directly from packets whenever they're hungry) is what your baby will learn to be 'normal'. 
            </p>  
                    <p class="mbn-text">
                    These habits around food can be hard to break and will tend to carry on throughout their life, which is why it's so important to get healthy eating off to a great start.

                    Some foods offer very little or no nutritional benefit. These discretionary or 'sometimes' foods (sometimes called junk foods) are often high in sugar, fat and salt and although they might make you feel good in the short term, they often leave you feeling sluggish and unwell in the long term.

            <p class="mbn-text" id="7.1.4m">
                Some examples of discretionary foods include:

                    <li>sausages and processed meats (e.g. ham, salami)
                    </li>
                    <li>commercial burgers, hot chips and fried foods

            <p class="mbn-text">
                Try setting yourself the target of reaching your <a href="#7.1.4">recommended daily number of serves</a> from each of the <a href="#7.1.4">5 major food groups</a> each day. Even if you don't reach it, every step closer will bring with it better health!

               Many of us find it hard to fit enough fruit and vegetables into our daily eating. But the good news is that it doesn't have to be. Try these tips to make a habit of reaching your <a href="#7.1.4">recommended daily number of serves</a> of <a href="#7.1.4">fruit</a> and <a href="#7.1.4">vegetables</a> every day.
            </p>  
            <p class="mbn-text">
                When choosing fruits and vegetables, try to remember to 'colour every plate like a rainbow', that is, opt for a variety of different coloured fruit and vegetables every day. This makes eating your fruit and vegetables more interesting for your taste buds whilst also increasing the number of different nutrients you receive!
            </p>    
              <ul>
                    <li>leave a bowl of fruit out where you will see them to remind you to eat them
                    </li>
                    <li>raw vegetables can make a quick and easy snack (e.g. carrot, celery, cucumber) - try dipping into low fat unsweetened plain natural yoghurt or <a href="#6.5.1">hummus</a> for extra flavour and energy
                    </li>
                    <li>try having 1-2 meat free days every week, focusing on beans/lentils, vegetables, tofu or egg instead (e.g. <a href="#6.4.1">vegetable stir-fry</a>, bean burrito, <a href="#6.4.1">lentil cottage pie</a> or mixed vegetable spaghetti Bolognese) - many people enjoy the challenge of a 'Meatless' or 'Meat Free' Monday
                    </li>
                    <li>try spreading avocado on toast (or even drizzling a little olive oil) instead of butter
                    </li>
                    <li>bulk out meals like soups, casseroles and stews with lentils (dried or canned) or any extra vegetables you have in the fridge - this also makes meat stretch further, saving you money

                <ul>
                    <li>keep a bottle or glass of water handy during the day to remind you to drink it (instead of drinks with added sugar) - this will also save money as water from the tap is essentially free!

                    <li>avoid fried foods when ordering takeaway - choose foods that have some vegetables included (e.g. vegetable noodles, stir fries, salads or a vegetable pizza)

                    <li>remind yourself to <a href="#7.1.4">snack on fruit and vegetables</a> by keeping these in places you can readily see (e.g. a fruit bowl on the table or cut up vegetables right in front of you when you open the fridge)

                    <li>try not to do your shopping when you're hungry as you'll be more likely to buy snack foods high in sugar, salt and fat (which also tend to cost you more money)

                    If you've just given birth, you should be able to start some gentle physical activity (such as walking) soon after childbirth but the main thing is that whatever you do feels comfortable for you. Start off slowly and then gradually increase how hard you go and for how long as you feel more able.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                    If you had a caesarean birth, it is best to avoid vigorous physical activity (e.g. running) for at least 6 weeks to give your body a chance to heal properly. Again, it's a good idea to talk with your GP or <a href="#8.1.2">maternal and child health nurse</a> if you are concerned or have any questions.

                   Walking is great for everyone, especially new mums - it is free, low impact, can be done any time, with or without friends and at your own pace. Walking has many health benefits and if you can squeeze in half an hour each day (at a pace which makes you slightly out of breath) you can improve your daily health and wellbeing as well as your long-term health.
            <p class="mbn-text">
                    If you're into running (or would like to start) you might like to look into getting a pram that you can safely run with. This is a great way to get some vigorous physical activity whilst getting out and about with your baby. It's also a chance for your partner to have some 'me' time if they don't want to join you.

             <b>Connecting with others</b>
        <p class="mbn-text">
               Compared to the time you had before you had a baby, you will probably also find you have less time to socialise. Spending a lot more time at home might leave you feeling confined to the house but it is important that you don't feel isolated.  
        </p>
        <p class="mbn-text">
                Ways to stay in touch with the outside world could be:
                <ul>
                    <li>calling a friend or family member                  
                    </li>
                    <li>catching up with other new parents for a walk and coffee

             <b>Bonding with your baby</b>
        <p class="mbn-text">
               Don't worry or feel ashamed if you don't feel an instant connection with your baby - this is perfectly normal!
        </p> 
        <p class="mbn-text">
                You might have been expecting to have an all-encompassing wave of unconditional love when your baby first arrived, but it <i>takes</i> time to form this bond as you get to know each other, just like with any other new relationship. 
        </p>   
        <p class="mbn-text">
                Many mums find that feeding time also doubles as good bonding time with their new baby. This is because the distance from your breast to your face lets your baby focus on your face (which is why it's often called the 'cuddle distance'). Talking to your baby as you  <a href="#1.1.1">breastfeed</a> them allows your baby to make the connection between your face and your voice which will be so familiar from the womb.
        </p> 
        <p class="mbn-text">
                Outside of feeding there are a  <a href="#1.1.9">plenty of other ways to bond with your baby</a>, which can be great for partners, especially if mum is doing all the feeding. Non-feeding bonding also teaches your baby that love does not have to involve the giving of food!

             <b>Working out new roles</b>
        <p class="mbn-text">
               Even though it's quite clear who mum is, it can take some time to fall into new roles. This can be especially true if mum was previously invested in full-time work and is now at home with the baby. It might also be the case that mum's partner wants to be a more involved parent, but current commitments (such as work and commuting) don't leave much time for helping with the baby.
        </p> 
        <p class="mbn-text">
                Ensuring you think about and discuss with your partner what each of your roles are, both inside and outside the home, is important for your own wellbeing, relationship and your baby's home environment. 
        </p>   
        <p class="mbn-text">
                Things to consider include your financial and work situations, what tasks need doing at home and what makes you happy. See some <a href="http://raisingchildren.net.au/articles/becoming_a_dad.html#working ">more starting points for discussions</a> around parental roles.

        <p class="mbn-text">
                Feeding aside, there are many other ways partners can get involved and this means your baby will be exposed (and adapt) to different styles of parenting, which helps them learn social skills.

              Choosing to return to (or start) work can be a tough decision after having a baby. In addition to earning enough money to keep a family clothed, sheltered, and fed, many people feel 'complete' by having a job and for most this can also be a positive experience outside of caring for a child.  
        </p>

            Children are extremely resilient and can not only cope with many different caring arrangements, they also enjoy new and challenging environments.

            If working at home is an option, you might like to discuss this with your employer. Although it may seem daunting, if you feel it would help make this adjustment period easier, it can't hurt. On the other hand, you might like the idea of keeping work and home life separate.

            Most friends and family are looking for a way to help - letting them will take some of the pressure of you!
        </p> 
         <p class="mbn-text">
                Simple things they could help with include:

                <ul>
                    <li>picking up food, groceries or other items you need when dropping by to visit
                    </li>
                    <li>preparing some of the week's meals - this could be something you do regularly (e.g. every Wednesday night
                    </li>
                    <li>doing some of the housework, such as a weekly vacuum - the housework will <i>always</i> be there but spending time with your baby is more important
                    </li>
                     <li>looking after your baby so you can <a href="#7.1.6">do something for yourself for a couple of hours</a> - this could be at a set time each week
                    </li>

                Stay organised by:
                <ul>
                    <li>keeping <a href="#7.1.4">easy, healthy foods</a> in the house such as canned beans or tuna, frozen vegetables, wholemeal pasta and brown rice - learn a <a href="#6.1.1">few easy recipes</a> using these items so you're never stuck for meals
                    </li>
                    <li>saving time wherever you can - for example:
                    </li>    
                    <ul>
                    <li>keep a shopping list on your mobile phone so you have it with you whenever you're out
                    </li>
                    <li>have a specific spot for your keys (and other items) so you always know where they are
                    </li>
                     <li>keep a nappy bag stocked with all the essentials so that you can leave the house more quickly
                    </li>
                     <li>order things you need online and have them delivered - including groceries

            It's not necessarily going to be easy but it will be worth it - see how other parents reflect on the challenges, achievements, positives and negatives of being a parent.
