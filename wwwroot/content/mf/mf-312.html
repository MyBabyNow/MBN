                'Not having enough milk' is the most common reason why mums give up breastfeeding yet in reality, only about 5% of mums really can't make enough milk. For many mums, what they think is a sign of low milk supply might really be something else.

            <ul>
                <li>it is normal for breasts to feel much softer or 'not as full' after the first few weeks of feeding your baby - your body has got used to making milk on demand

                <li><a onclick="localSecJump('bf/bf-1111.html#1.1.11');">expressing</a> is not a 'measure' of how much milk you make - your baby is much better at getting out your milk than your hand or a <a onclick="localSecJump('bf/bf-1117.html#1.1.17h');">breast pump</a>!

            <p class="mbn-text" id="3.1.2c">
                If your baby doesn't seem to be <a onclick="localSecJump('sfp/sfp-515.html#5.1.5');">growing as well</a> as they should, it may be that your milk supply is low or your baby does not remove enough milk when feeding (a <a onclick="localSecJump('bf/bf-114.html#1.1.4g');">bad attachment</a>).

            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                It is also possible to have your baby's <a onclick="localSecJump('bf/bf-114.html#1.1.4g');">attachment</a> checked and <a onclick="localSecJump('bf/bf-113.html#1.1.3i');">your own milk supply

            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Consider the following if you're wondering about whether formula will be more convenient than breastfeeding:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>it takes time to prepare a bottle - you need to make sure your hands are very clean, that your equipment is sterile and that you always follow the instructions carefully
                </li>
                <li>it takes time to clean equipment properly - using formula means you will need to <a onclick="localSecJump('ff/ff-213.html#2.1.3a');">sterilise feeding equipment</a>
                </li>
                <li>a made-up formula feed has a shorter shelf-life than <a onclick="localSecJump('bf/bf-1111.html#1.1.11t');">expressed breastmilk</a> - which means it won't last as long
                </li>
                <li>it's very convenient to be able to breastfeed your baby anywhere, anytime, and you're unlikely to have a negative experience doing this (check out these <a onclick="localSecJump('bf/bf-116.html#1.1.6d');">tips for breastfeeding in public</a>)
                </li>
                <li>using formula increases spending for your family - a single tin of formula costs around $25 and once open, must be used within a month (make sure you check the instructions on whichever brand of formula you have though)
                </li>
                <li>someone else can make up a feed and/or feed your baby when you use formula...but you can also have someone else feed your baby breastmilk if you <a onclick="localSecJump('bf/bf-1111.html#1.1.11');">express!</a> Check out how <a onclick="localSecJump('bf/bf-119.html#1.1.9e');">your partner can help with breastfeeding</a> (and don't be shy to share this with them!)
                </li>
                <li>you will be able to share the feeding role with someone else more and more as your baby gets older and <a onclick="localSecJump('solids/solids-411.html#4.1.1');">starts having solids</a>

            <p class="mbn-text">
                Some parents are told that giving their baby formula will help their baby sleep longer at night, however, most babies wake through the night for the first few months to feed, regardless of whether they are formula-fed or breastfed. <a onclick="localSecJump('sfp/sfp-511.html#5.1.1');">Frequent feeding</a> is normal for <i>all</i> babies.

            <p class="mbn-text">
                In fact, some research shows that breastfeeding mums can get <i>more</i> sleep than formula feeding mums because breastfeeding in the middle of the night is much quicker and easier than getting up to prepare a bottle!

            <p class="mbn-text">
                If more sleep is why you are thinking about introducing formula, keep in mind that giving formula may reduce your <a onclick="localSecJump('mf-313.html#3.1.3');">milk supply</a> - especially if you introduce formula before your milk supply is established (around 6 weeks).

            <p class="mbn-text">
                Australian law protects your right to breastfeed or <a onclick="localSecJump('bf/bf-1111.html#1.1.11');">express milk</a> at work should you choose to. Many mums continue to breastfeed their babies once they return to work and find that keeping that connection with their babies helps make the adjustment back to work a bit easier for both mum and baby.

            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                For other mums, having their baby be formula-fed while they are at work is more suitable. This doesn't mean you can't breastfeed outside work hours, especially if you have already set up your <a onclick="localSecJump('mf-313.html#3.1.3');">milk supply</a>, as your body will quickly adapt to however many breastfeeds your baby has and your new schedule.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                For example, this might mean that you only breastfeed:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>before work

            <p class="mbn-text">
                If you intend to have your carer formula feed your baby while you work, about 1-2 weeks before going back, it's a good idea to get your baby used to:

If you think your baby is reacting to something in your breastmilk, speak to your <a onclick="localSecJump('bf/bf-119.html#1.1.9h');">GP</a>, <a onclick="localSecJump('bf/bf-119.html#1.1.9j');">lactation consultant</a> or <a onclick="localSecJump('bf/bf-119.html#1.1.9i');">maternal and child

            <p class="mbn-text">
                If your baby is reacting to something in your milk, some health professionals may suggest switching to formula, however this isn't always necessary. You may be able to simply <i>avoid these foods</i> while breastfeeding.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Your baby will have less risk of ongoing allergies if you can change your diet and continue to breastfeed them, instead of giving them formula, because breastfeeding is actually <i>protective</i> of allergies. A specialist can advise you whether this is an option for you.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                If your GP hasn't already referred you, make sure you ask for a referral to a paediatrician or <a onclick="localSecJump('hs/hs-815.html#8.1.5');">dietitian who

            <p class="mbn-text">
                If your baby doesn't seem satisfied or is fussy with your breast it doesn't necessarily mean they are still hungry and needing more breastmilk - sometimes it can be because there is <a onclick="localSecJump('bf/bf-113.html#1.1.3k');">too much milk</a>!
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Babies go through rapid development in their first year of life, and sometimes it can be difficult to predict their feeding patterns. They may have times where they are fussier or hungrier than usual - this is normal for all babies.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                If you have been breastfeeding your baby whenever they <a onclick="localSecJump('sfp/sfp-514.html#5.1.4');">seem hungry</a>, and they are <a onclick="localSecJump('bf/bf-114.html#1.1.4g');">attaching on well</a> it is unlikely that your milk is why they are unsatisfied.

                To get used to the bottle
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Babies are very adaptable and learn quickly - especially when it comes to something as important as food! They can get used to a bottle <i>any</i> time it is introduced to them but are more likely to refuse it if mum is giving it (because they can smell your breastmilk) so try to give this job to someone else if possible.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                It may take a little longer once your baby is older and stronger (and can let you know what they do and don't like more easily) but they <i>will</i> get there eventually.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Once your baby is used to a bottle, it is actually more likely that your baby will <a onclick="localSecJump('bf/bf-118.html#1.1.8o');">refuse your breast</a>, rather than the bottle, because they have to work harder to get milk from your breast!
