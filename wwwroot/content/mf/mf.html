                <b>What is mixed feeding?</b>
            </p>
                Mixed feeding simply means your baby has a combination of both your breastmilk and formula.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                There are many reasons why you may choose to mix feed your baby. Whatever the reason, deciding to mix feed is a personal decision that depends on the unique relationship between you and your baby, your family situation and any professional advice that you receive.
            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                If you think mixed feeding may work for you and your baby, it is important to first speak with your <a href="#1.1.9">GP</a>, <a href="#1.1.9">maternal and child health nurse</a>, <a href="#1.1.9">a lactation consultant</a> or call the <a href="#Phone 1800686268">ABA</a> helpline before making changes.

                <b>Is mixed feeding recommended?</b>
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Until around 6 months old, it is recommended that giving only <a href="#1.1.1">breastmilk</a> is healthiest for your baby. After 6 months, it is recommended that babies keep breastfeeding alongside <a href="#4.1.1">starting solid foods</a>.
            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Many mums either can't fully breastfeed or choose not to, and therefore replace some breastfeeds with formula instead. Mixed feeding means your baby will still get some breastmilk, which is better than no breastmilk! But keep in mind that replacing some breastfeeds with formula will reduce your <a href="#3.1.3">milk supply</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                If your baby needs extra feeds with formula for their health and <a href="#5.1.5">growth</a>, or you need to mix feed your baby for your own health and wellbeing, be confident that you are making the right decision for your family.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Remember:
                <ul>
                    <li>regularly giving your baby formula instead of breastmilk means they will miss out on some of the protective <a href="#1.1.1">benefits of breastmilk</a> and doing so will also reduce your <a href="#3.1.3">milk supply</a>.

                    If you’re still unsure if you have <a href="#1.1.3">low milk supply</a>, keep in mind that:
                <ul>
                    <li>it is normal for breasts to feel much softer or 'not as full' after the first few weeks of feeding your baby – your body has got used to making milk on demand
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="#1.1.11">expressing</a> is not a 'measure' of how much milk you make – your baby is much better at getting out your milk than your hand or a <a href="#1.1.17">breast pump</a>!
                    </li>   
                    <li>your baby might <a href="#1.1.8">refuse your breast</a> for a variety of reasons
                    </li> 
                    <li><a href="#5.1.8">crying</a>, even after feeding, doesn’t always mean your baby is still <a href="#5.1.4">hungry</a>

                  <br />
                    If your baby doesn't seem to be <a href="#5.1.5">growing as well</a> as they should, it may be that your milk supply is low or your baby does not remove enough milk when feeding (a <a href="#1.1.4">bad attachment</a>). In this case, a health professional may suggest using formula to boost your <a href="#5.1.5">baby's growth</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                    It is also possible to have your baby's <a href="#1.1.4">attachment</a> checked and <a href="#1.1.3">your own milk supply increased</a>, if you would prefer. Ask your <a href="#1.1.9">GP</a>, <a href="#1.1.9">lactation consultant</a> or maternal and <a href="#1.1.9">child health nurse</a> about this option.
            </p>  
            <p class="mbn-text">
                    GPs generally don't receive much training in breastfeeding, so it’s a good idea to ask to be referred to a specialist for advice or contact one directly via the <a href="#8.1.5">help and support section</a>.

                    For some people giving formula feels more convenient than breastfeeding.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                    Consider the following if you're wondering about whether formula will be more convenient than breastfeeding:
                <ul>
                    <li>it takes time to prepare a bottle - you need to make sure your hands are very clean, that your equipment is sterile and that you always follow the instructions carefully
                    </li>
                    <li>it takes time to clean equipment properly - using formula means you will need to <a href="#2.1.3">sterilise feeding equipment</a>
                    </li>   
                    <li>a made-up formula feed has a shorter shelf-life than <a href="#1.1.11">expressed breastmilk</a> - which means it won't last as long
                    </li> 
                    <li>it's very convenient to be able to breastfeed your baby anywhere, anytime, and you're unlikely to have a negative experience doing this (check out these <a href="#1.1.6">tips for breastfeeding in public</a>)
                    </li>  
                     <li>using formula increases spending for your family - a single tin of formula costs around $25 and once open, must be used within a month (make sure you check the instructions on whichever brand of formula you have though)
                    </li> 
                    <li>someone else can make up a feed and/or feed your baby when you use formula …but you can also have someone else feed your baby breastmilk if you <a href="#1.1.11">express!</a> Check out how <a href="#1.1.9">your partner can help with breastfeeding</a> (and don't be shy to share this with them!)
                    </li> 
                    <li>you will be able to share the feeding role with someone else more and more as your baby gets older and <a href="#4.1.1">starts having solids</a>

                   Some parents are told that giving their baby formula will help their baby sleep longer at night, however, most babies wake through the night for the first few months to feed, regardless of whether they are formula-fed or breastfed. <a href="#5.1.1">Frequent feeding</a> is normal for <i>all</i> babies.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   In fact, some research shows that breastfeeding mums can get <i>more</i> sleep than formula feeding mums because breastfeeding in the middle of the night is much quicker and easier than getting up to prepare a bottle!

            <p class="mbn-text">
                   If more sleep is why you are thinking about introducing formula, keep in mind that giving formula may reduce your <a href="#3.1.3">milk supply</a> - especially if you introduce formula before your milk supply is established (around 6 weeks).

Many mums continue to breastfeed their babies once they return to work and find that keeping that connection with their babies helps make the adjustment back to work a bit easier for both mum and baby.

            <p class="mbn-text">
                   For other mums, having their baby be formula-fed while they are at work is more suitable. This doesn't mean you can't breastfeed outside work hours, especially if you have already set up your <a href="#3.1.3">milk supply</a>, as your body will quickly adapt to however many breastfeeds your baby has and your new schedule.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                    For example, this might mean that you only breastfeed:
                <ul>
                    <li>before work
                    </li>
                    <li>after work
                    </li>
                    <li>on your days off - to help <a href="#3.1.3">keep up your supply</a>
                    </li>   
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                  If you intend to have your carer formula feed your baby while you work, about 1-2 weeks before going back, it's a good idea to get your baby used to:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#2.1.5">taking a bottle</a> (if they're not already) - it takes time but they <i>will</i> get there

                    </li>                      
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">

                   Some babies can have <a href="#1.1.8">allergies</a> or <a href="#1.1.8">intolerances</a> and react to traces of food in their mum's breastmilk although this is uncommon and needs to be checked by a GP.

                   If your baby is reacting to something in your milk, some health professionals may suggest switching to formula, however this isn't always necessary. You may be able to simply <i>avoid these foods</i> while breastfeeding.

            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Your baby will have less risk of ongoing allergies if you can change your diet and continue to breastfeed them, instead of giving them formula, because breastfeeding is actually <i>protective</i> of allergies. A specialist can advise you whether this is an option for you.

                   If your baby doesn't seem satisfied or is fussy with your breast it doesn't necessarily mean they are still hungry and needing more breastmilk - sometimes it can be because there is <a href="#1.1.3">too much milk</a>!

                   Babies are very adaptable and learn quickly - especially when it comes to something as important as food! They can get used to a bottle <i>any</i> time it is introduced to them but are more likely to refuse it if mum is giving it (because they can smell your breastmilk) so try to give this job to someone else if possible.

                   It may take a little longer once your baby is older and stronger (and can let you know what they do and don't like more easily) but they <i>will</i> get there eventually.

            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Once your baby is used to a bottle, it is actually more likely that your baby will <a href="#1.1.8">refuse your breast</a>, rather than the bottle, because they have to work harder to get milk from your breast!

                   It usually takes from birth to 6 weeks to establish your milk supply. By then, your body should be used to making milk for your baby and you will find your breasts start to feel softer and less full than they used to. This is normal and does not mean your milk supply is reducing, it just means your breasts are getting good at giving milk on demand!

            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Any regular replacement of a breastfeed (even just once a day) will affect your milk supply because <a href="#3.1.3">milk supply</a> responds to the demand from your baby. One way to keep up your milk supply is to fit in some extra <a href="#1.1.11">expression sessions</a>.

             <p class="mbn-text">
                   If you are going to 'top up' your baby with formula, be sure to:
                <ul>
                    <li>always breastfeed <i>first</i> before offering the bottle
                    </li>
                    <li>avoid giving your baby formula in between breastfeeds as this might make them too full to have a big breastfeed, which can then start a cycle of reducing demand on your <a href="#3.1.3">milk supply</a>, often referred to as the ‘top up trap’

            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Some babies adjust to feeding from a bottle very quickly, while others need a bit of time. All babies are adaptable and can learn to feed from both the breast and from a bottle.
            </p>
             <p class="mbn-text">
                   While your baby is getting used to being fed from a bottle, it may be easier for somebody else to feed them. Your baby can smell your breastmilk and may refuse the bottle and/or formula if your breasts are close by!
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Once your baby is used to feeding from a bottle, use this time as important cuddling and bonding time as usual.

Once your baby has reached 12 months, they can then have <a href="#4.1.6">regular full cream cow's milk</a> as their drink instead. Babies do not need follow-on formulas or toddler milks.

                     It is likely that by regularly giving your baby formula, your <a href="#3.1.3">milk supply</a> will be affected. Your body responds to your baby's demand for milk, so if they are feeding less from the breast, then your body will make less milk. This is one of the reasons why it's important to be clear in your decision about <a href="#3.1.2a">why you want to mix feed</a> and how you will do it.
            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                     Remember, many mums worry they don't make enough milk for their baby, but this is unlikely if you have been feeding your baby whenever they are <a href="#5.1.4">hungry</a> and they are <a href="#1.1.4g">attached on properly</a>. If your baby is unsettled it may not be because they're hungry!

            <p class="mbn-text">
                     The amount of formula you give your baby will depend on your <a href="#3.1.5">reasons for giving it</a>. Remember, any regular replacement of a breastmilk will lead to a reduction in your <a href="#3.1.3">milk supply</a> (your body gets used to making less breastmilk because your baby is removing less).
            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                    If you are given specific advice from a health professional on how much formula to give – you should follow that advice.

            <p class="mbn-text" id="3.1.6h">
                    If you want to keep up your <a href="#3.1.3">milk supply</a> while also giving formula, be sure to:
                <ul>
                    <li>always breastfeed <i>before</i> offering the bottle
                    <li>avoid giving your baby formula between breastfeeds as this might make them too full to have a big breastfeed which can then start a cycle of reducing demand on your <a href="#3.1.3">milk supply</a>
                    </li> 
                    <li>start slowly and with small amounts of formula – the average 4kg baby that is being exclusively formula-fed will only have around 100mL at each formula feed, so start with much less than this
                    </li>

                    </li> 
                    <li>be guided by your baby's <a href="#5.1.4">appetite</a> – don't force them to finish a bottle
                    </li>
