            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Your baby's feed doesn't <i>need</i> to be warmed. You might actually find it easier to get your baby used to formula at room temperature so that when <a onclick="localSecJump('ff-217.html#2.1.7');">you're out</a>, you don't have to bother warming the bottle.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                If you decide to warm the feed, when you are ready to use it, place the bottle in a container of warm water to heat it up. Test the feed on the inside of your wrist before giving it to your baby - it should feel warm or cool, but not hot.
            </p>

                Storing a feed
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                It is best if a feed is made up just before your baby needs it. However, if you need to store a feed for future use, there are some guidelines you should follow to reduce the risk of your baby developing a tummy upset or other infection.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                How to store made up formula (that you haven't yet offered to your baby):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><i><u>Refrigerator:</u></i> place on the top shelf at the back of the fridge (where it is coldest) no longer than 1 hour after making but throw away after 24 hours.
                </li>
                <li><i><u>Cool bag with ice pack:</u></i> throw away after 2 hours (as cool bags don't always keep foods chilled properly).
                </li>
                <li><i><u>Room temperature:</u></i> throw away after 1 hour.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mbn-text">
                If there is formula left in the bottle after a feed, don't store it, throw it away!
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Bacteria multiply very quickly at room temperature and can still survive and grow inside the fridge (although more slowly). The risk of bacteria multiplying in your baby's bottle increases with the length of time a made up formula is stored, making it unsafe for them to drink.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                A good rule of thumb is: <i>if in doubt, throw it out!</i>

            <p class="mbn-section" id="2.1.4h">
                Important tips
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text" id="2.1.4i">
                <b>1. Fill the scoop <i>loosely</i> and level it off</b>
                <br /> The formula powder should not be packed into the scoop tightly or heaped up over the top. Packing the scoop loosely and levelling it off ensures that your baby's formula will not be too concentrated for their small body to handle. If formula is made up too concentrated, it can cause your baby to develop 'osmotic diarrhoea'. This is when your baby's body tries to dilute the concentrated formula sitting in their gut by mixing in water that has been sucked out of other parts of their body, which can cause them to become dehydrated.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                If your baby's formula continues to be made up too concentrated (by continuing to add too much formula powder into the scoop), it can cause severe dehydration in your baby, which could lead to a rare but serious condition called 'hypernatraemic dehydration'. Sadly, it's quite common not to notice symptoms of this condition until your baby has neurological problems, which can be permanent.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                This is why it is so important to always loosely fill and then level off the formula powder in the scoop when making up a feed for your baby.
            </p>

            <p class="mbn-text" id="2.1.4j">
                <b>2. Use the scoop that came with the formula you're using</b>
                <br> Different brands use different size scoops. To make sure you are making up your baby's formula to the <a onclick="localSecJump('2.1.4i');">correct concentration</a>, always use the scoop that came with the tin or packet of formula you're using. Never alternate scoops with different formulas.
            </p>

            <p class="mbn-text" id="2.1.4k">
                <b>3. Use the correct amount of formula powder</b>

                <br> Adding the water to your baby's bottle <i>before</i> adding the formula powder lets you make sure your baby is getting the right amount of fluid and prevents <a onclick="localSecJump('2.1.4i');">over concentrating</a> the feed.
