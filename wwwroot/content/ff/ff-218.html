                It is recommended that babies stop using a bottle by 12 months of age and that by 12 months, your baby should only be having drinks from a cup.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Rather than suddenly taking the bottle away and replacing it with a cup, it's important to <a onclick="localSecJump('solids/solids-416.html#4.1.6g');">introduce a sippy cup from around 6 months of age</a>. Think of a sippy cup like a 'training' cup that will give your baby a chance to transition to proper cups (which will give you a chance to reduce and then take away the bottle altogether).

                <b>What to put in the cup</b>
                <br> This depends on your baby's age.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Generally, if your baby is <a onclick="localSecJump('solids/solids-416.html#4.1.6b');">under 12 months</a>, cooled boiled water, <a onclick="localSecJump('ff-212.html#2.1.2b');">step 1 formula</a> or breastmilk are the only drinks that should go in your baby's cup.

                Once your baby <a onclick="localSecJump('solids/solids-416.html#4.1.6d');">reaches 12 months</a>, they no longer need formula, including <a onclick="localSecJump('ff-212.html#2.1.2d');">toddler milks</a>.

                Taking away the bottle can be hard but it's also <i>important</i>
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Some of the reasons parents keep using the bottle after their baby reaches 12 months are because they believe that:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>using a cup is messy
                </li>
                <li>their baby won't drink enough out of a cup
                </li>
                <li>the bottle comforts their baby, especially for <a onclick="localSecJump('ff-215.html#2.1.5j');">going to sleep</a>
                </li>
                <li>their baby <i>prefers</i> the bottle to a cup
                </li>
                <li>taking away their baby's bottle is denying their child of food and drink
                </li>
                <li>there will be <a onclick="localSecJump('2.1.8d');">lots of tantrums</a> if the bottle is taken away
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mbn-text">
                But, there are many <a onclick="localSecJump('2.1.8e');">health reasons</a> for helping your baby transition from a bottle to a cup by 15 months (at least). Doing this by <i>12 months</i> is much better though, because waiting until your child gets older and their habits and preferences develop further, makes this transition even harder for everyone involved.
            </p>

            <p class="mbn-text" id="2.1.8d">
                Battles over the bottle can often be very disruptive to the family environment! The good news is that although it might be disruptive <i>now</i>, this transition will soon be over and things should settle down again.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Try to keep in mind that:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>as a parent your responsibility is to do your best to protect your child from harm - and using a bottle for too long <a onclick="localSecJump('2.1.8e');">is harmful</a>
                </li>
                <li>your baby won't <i>understand</i> why taking away their bottle is important, which can cause multiple occasions of tears and tantrums - but they'll only be temporary
                </li>
                <li>lots of cuddles and support can help your baby through this transition - some ideas you might like to try:
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>switching 'bottle time' with one-on-one time
                    </li>
                    <li>reading a book together
                    </li>
                    <li>playing with shadows on a wall with a torch
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>most children will settle for a cup when they realise that no one will give them a bottle (caregivers included) and it's not just you being mean - so it's important to make sure <i>everyone</i> helps with the transition

                <br> Giving your baby bottles in <a onclick="localSecJump('ff-215.html#2.1.5j');">bed at night</a> can let milk settle in their throat, which can then cause bacteria to move into their ears, increasing the chance of painful ear infections.
            </p>

            <p class="mbn-text" id="2.1.8f">
                <b>Tooth decay</b>
                <br> If your baby is always sucking milk (not water) from a bottle, their teeth are continually bathing in the natural sugars found in the milk. This can lead to tooth decay and rotting of their teeth - which is very painful!
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Tooth decay tends to be <i>even worse</i> when bottles are left sitting in the mouth <a onclick="localSecJump('ff-215.html#2.1.5j');">while sleeping</a>.

                <b>Iron deficiency and malnutrition</b>
                <br> Solid foods need to be <a onclick="localSecJump('solids/solids-411.html#4.1.1a');">introduced from around 6 months</a> because breastmilk or formula no longer supply enough of the key nutrients (such as <a onclick="localSecJump('solids/solids-419.html#4.1.9b');">iron</a>) that your baby's rapidly developing body needs. Once your baby reaches 12 months, their main nutrition should be coming from <a onclick="localSecJump('solids/solids-418.html#4.1.8a');">family meals</a> instead of milk.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Babies who continue using bottles after 12 months of age tend to do so more for habit or calming reasons but this means they also tend to drink more milk than they actually need.

                <b>Overweight</b>
                <br> Because babies who continue using bottles after 12 months of age tend to do so more for <i>habit</i> or <i>calming</i> reasons rather than because they're hungry, they often drink more milk than they actually need. More milk than needed also means more energy (kilojoules/calories) than needed and this can lead to unhealthy weight gain.

                <li>reduce their ability to recognise their fullness signs - this can promote overeating and lead to weight gain

                <b>Step 5: get rid of all the bottles (if possible)</b>
                <br> Get rid of all the bottles in the home - your baby will be less likely to want them if they can't see them around. Of course, this step might not be possible if there is another younger child in the home.
            </p>

                <b>Step 6: be pleased!</b>
                <br> Getting your baby to give up the bottle can be a challenging process but you should also take a moment to feel pleased - you have taken an important step towards protecting your child's health and encouraging their development! Well done!
