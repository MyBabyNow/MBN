            <p class="mbn-text">
                Feeding your baby not only provides them with nourishment but also helps with bonding, emotional security and physical development. Surprisingly, it also has the capability to increase literacy (speaking, reading and writing) skills!
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                The more you sing, read, smile, and talk to your baby the more it activates cell growth and cellular connections in their brain. These connections form the early neural circuitry that will eventually be the foundation for learning.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                So holding your baby while feeding them a bottle is an ideal time for you both to connect <i>and</i> to increase their ability to learn!

                The below steps are a guide to feeding your baby with a bottle:
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                <b>Sit comfortably and hold your baby close</b>, looking into their eyes to help them feel safe, protected and loved.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                <b>Hold your baby upright</b>, with their head supported so that they can breathe and are able to swallow comfortably.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                <b>Brush the teat against your baby's lips</b> and when your baby's mouth opens wide, let them draw in the teat.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                <b>Hold the bottle horizontal to the ground</b>, tilting it just enough to ensure your baby is getting milk, not air, through the teat - you will see bubbles in the bottle as your baby feeds.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                <b>If you can't see any bubbles</b>, break the suction between your baby's tongue and the teat by moving the teat slightly to the side of their mouth until you can see bubbles.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                <b>If the teat becomes flattened</b> while you are feeding, pull gently on the corner of your baby's mouth to release the vacuum.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                <b>When your baby does not want any more feed</b>, hold them upright and gently rub or pat their back to <a onclick="localSecJump('ff-219.html#2.1.9c');">burp them</a> - there may not be much wind to bring up. If there is any formula left over, throw it away. Resist the urge to <a onclick="localSecJump('2.1.5i');">encourage your baby to finish it</a> - there is no need for your baby to finish a bottle if they have shown you their <a onclick="localSecJump('sfp/sfp-514.html#5.1.4');">fullness signs</a>.
            </p>

            <p class="mbn-text" id="2.1.5c">
                <b>Do not add cereal, cordial, tea, honey or flavourings</b> to a bottle. Doing so is unsafe and can cause several problems, including <a onclick="localSecJump('2.1.5h');">overfeeding</a> your baby. If you are thinking about adding anything to your baby's bottles other than formula, speak with your GP or <a onclick="localSecJump('hs/hs-814.html#8.1.4e');">maternal and child health nurse </a> first.
            </p>

            <p class="mbn-text" id="2.1.5d">
                <b>Tips:</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Babies feed in bursts of sucking with short pauses to rest and sometimes burp, so don't stress if your baby doesn't suck continuously.
                </li>
                <li>Interrupting the feed now and again lets your baby notice how 'full' they feel so they don't <a onclick="localSecJump('2.1.5h');">overfeed</a>.
                </li>
                <li>Always hold your baby and never leave them unattended while feeding from a bottle. This includes <a onclick="localSecJump('2.1.5k');">never leaving them to fall asleep with a bottle</a> - night or day.
                </li>
                <li><a onclick="localSecJump('2.1.5k');">Never prop your baby up with the bottle</a> - this can be a choking hazard, particularly if they fall asleep.
                </li>
                <li>Letting your baby drink from a bottle <a onclick="localSecJump('2.1.5k');">while lying down</a> can increase the risk of ear infections and tooth decay.
                </li>
            </ul>

                How often to feed
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Although most babies gradually settle into a feeding pattern, they vary in how often they want to feed and <a onclick="localSecJump('ff-216.html#2.1.6a');">how much</a> they want to drink. This is completely normal! Just like you, there will be some days when your baby is hungrier than others.

            </ul>

            <p class="mbn-text">
                All babies should be fed 'on-demand' (regardless of the type of milk they are receiving) which means feeding your baby when they show <a onclick="localSecJump('sfp/sfp-514.html#5.1.4');">signs that they are hungry</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Don't worry too much about following the frequency 'guide' section on the tin or packet - these often suggest feeding babies larger amounts of formula, and less often, than health professionals recommend or than parents who feed 'on-demand' generally experience.

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Babies tend to feed little and often, which means they might not finish their bottle - throw away any unfinished formula after a feed.
                </li>
                <li>A big feed doesn't mean your baby will go longer between feeds.
                </li>
                <li>Your baby is likely to need <a onclick="localSecJump('sfp/sfp-511.html#5.1.1g');">night feeds</a> for at least the first few months of their life but these should reduce, as your baby gets older.

            <p class="mbn-text">
                There is no set amount or volume that your baby should have for each feed. Different babies drink different amounts of formula and the amount your baby drinks may vary from day-to-day.

                If your baby goes to sleep before they are full, try waking them up by putting them over your shoulder, rubbing their back, legs and tummy or by changing their nappy. Wait until your baby is properly awake before offering them more milk.
