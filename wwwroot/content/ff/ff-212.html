                Formulas labelled as 'follow-on' or 'step 2' are only suitable for babies <i>6 months and older</i>. These formulas should <b>never</b> be given to a baby under 6 months old as they are too advanced for your baby's developing body.

                Even when your baby reaches 6 months, there is still no need to switch to a follow-on or step 2 formula. The main reason these formulas were originally created was as a way to get around advertising regulations in some countries, not because of health!

            <p class="mbn-text">
                Follow-on or step 2 formulas tend to have <i>higher</i> amounts of protein than your baby needs.

                Toddler milk and step 3 formulas are just another way for companies to market their brand as they are extremely limited when it comes to advertising formulas for babies under 12 months of age. Because they <b>are</b> allowed to target advertising to parents with toddlers <i>over</i> 12 months, you will see toddler milks advertised, rather than those aimed at younger babies.

                Soy milk formula is made from soy beans rather than cow's milk. It should only be used in exceptional circumstances and under the guidance of a GP or <a onclick="localSecJump('hs/hs-815.html#8.1.5l');">dietitian</a>.

                Goat's milk formula is based on goat's milk rather than cow's milk and is not recommended for babies under 12 months old. Goat's milk does not seem to have any role in preventing or treating allergies. In fact, it is often the case that babies who are allergic to cow's milk are also allergic to soy and goat's milk.

                Hydrolysed (HA) formula

            <p class="mbn-text">
                Hydrolysed or partially hydrolysed (HA) formula is a cow's milk based formula that has been processed to break down most of the proteins into smaller parts. They are sometimes called 'low allergen' or 'hypoallergenic' however they are <b>not</b> recommended for the <a onclick="localSecJump('mf/mf-312.html#3.1.2i');">prevention of allergies</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Even if labelled as 'hypoallergenic', some formulas are still not suitable for babies who have a diagnosed cow's milk allergy. If you think your baby might have an allergy to cow's milk, you should speak to your GP or <a onclick="localSecJump('hs/hs-814.html#8.1.4e');">maternal and child health nurse</a>.

            <p class="mbn-text">
                Lactose (milk sugar) is naturally found in breastmilk and most formulas. Many formula companies make lactose free versions of their cow's milk based formulas.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Speak to your GP or <a onclick="localSecJump('hs/hs-814.html#8.1.4e');">maternal and child health nurse</a> if you think your baby might be lactose intolerant.

                Thickened formula (AR)
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Thickened formulas are labelled with AR, which stands for 'anti-regurgitation'. These formulas are designed for babies with <a onclick="localSecJump('bf/bf-118.html#1.1.8q');">reflux</a> and so tend to be thicker to help keep the formula down after a feed, but they do not always work.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                If using an AR formula, you may need a teat with more holes so that your baby can drink the milk more easily. These formulas should only be used under medical supervision.

                Ready to feed liquid formula
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Ready to feed formula is usually sold in cartons and is sterile. This means it contains no germs or bacteria, which could harm your baby. However, it is often more expensive than other types of formulas.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Ready to feed liquid formula is suitable for high-risk babies, such as those that are pre-term, low-birth weight or particularly vulnerable to infections.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Once opened, the formula should be poured into <a onclick="localSecJump('ff-213.html#2.1.3a');">sterile bottles</a> that can then be <a onclick="localSecJump('ff-214.html#2.1.4f');">warmed in the bottle</a> later if desired. Any unused liquid formula must be refrigerated below 5&#x2103; and used within 24 hours.

                Special ingredients added to formula
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Some formulas, often labelled as 'Gold', have added ingredients to make them more like breastmilk. There is limited evidence around the benefit of these additional ingredients and they may not make the formula any healthier for your baby. Formulas with these added ingredients, however, are almost always more expensive.
            </p>

            <p class="mbn-text" id="2.1.2m">
                Probiotics and prebiotics can help formula-fed babies grow healthy bacteria in their bowels. This may help babies have <a onclick="localSecJump('ff-219.html#2.1.9a');">softer poos</a>, experience less nappy rash and decrease their chances of gastroenteritis.

                Although long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCP for short!) Ps have been shown to be important for brain and nerve development, we don't know if babies can absorb them from <i>formulas</i>. That said, LCPs <i>might</i> be helpful for formula-fed premature infant development.
