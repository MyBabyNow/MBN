            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Milk is carried within ducts inside the breast and sometimes these can become blocked. A blocked duct can be caused by many reasons, including wearing clothing that is too tight or sleeping on your stomach (and breasts). It is important to try to clear a blocked duct straight away to prevent it getting worse and possibly developing into <a onclick="localSecJump('bf-118.html#1.1.8d');">mastitis</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                You may have a blocked duct if your breast feels lumpy or engorged and is sore or red.

            <p class="mbn-text">
                Clear a blocked duct by:
            </p>
            <ul>

                <b>Will formula help?</b>
                <br> No. Giving your baby formula soon after birth can actually <i>trigger</i> allergy to cow's milk in a baby prone to allergy, even if they are later breastfed. Soy and goat's milk formulas do not protect against allergies either. Read more about the <a onclick="localSecJump('ff/ff-212.html');">different types of formulas</a>.

                <b>Reflux</b>
                <br> Reflux is the name for when babies spit up some milk. Babies can either have gastro-oesophageal reflux (simple reflux) or gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD).

                <b>Simple reflux</b>
                <br> Most babies bring up milk at least once a day and many of them will do it more often than that! These babies are generally happy and <a onclick="localSecJump('sfp/sfp-515.html');">putting on weight</a> (a "happy chucker"!). This reflux doesn't hurt your baby and will stop as they get older.

                </ul>
                <li>avoiding too much quick movement or pressure on their tummy, especially after a feed

                <ul>
                    <li>when changing a nappy, turn your baby to the side to wipe their bottom

                    <li>play gently with your baby, preferably before feeding them

                    <li>pass your baby around to others gently
