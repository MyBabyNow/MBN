                    <li><u>being patient if you don't feel like being intimate</u> - you might feel 'touched out' if you've been feeding, carrying and settling your baby all day!

                    <li><u>helping with the night feeds</u> - bringing your baby to you when you're in bed, then burping, changing and settling your baby to allow you to get a bit more valuable sleep, even if for only some of the night feeds

                    </li>
                    <li><u>breastfeeding takes time to learn, often up to 6-8 weeks</u> - once a good breastfeeding system has been established, your partner might like to try <a onclick="localSecJump('bf-1111.html');">expressing</a> some breastmilk so she can have a break and others can give the <a onclick="localSecJump('bf-1112.html');">occasional bottle feed</a>
                    </li>
                    <li><u>breastfeeding can be uncomfortable when starting out but it should never be painful</u> - provided the baby is <a onclick="localSecJump('bf-114.html#1.1.4g');">attached properly</a>, after 30-60 seconds any discomfort should reduce; if it continues, the baby might not be <a onclick="localSecJump('bf-114.html#1.1.4g');">attached</a> or <a onclick="localSecJump('bf-114.html#1.1.4a');">positioned properly</a> and your partner should <a onclick="localSecJump('1.1.9g');">seek help</a>
                    </li>
                    <li><u>you might be able to settle your baby more easily than your breastfeeding partner</u> - when your baby is being fussy, smelling breastmilk on mum can make your baby seek out her breasts instead of calming down
                    </li>
                    <li><u>sagging breasts are not caused by breastfeeding</u> - pregnancy, age, smoking, genetics and weight loss will affect breast shape, but not breastfeeding
