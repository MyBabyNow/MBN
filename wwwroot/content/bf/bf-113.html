                Some mums worry that breastfeeding frequently means that they don't have enough milk, but this is normal, especially for young babies and during growth spurts. When your baby is <a onclick="localSecJump('bf-114.html#1.1.4g');">attached on properly</a>, each time you breastfeed messages between your brain and breasts signal your body to make more milk to build up your milk supply.

                Your baby only has a tiny tummy and it digests your breastmilk very well, so your baby needs to be fed often, especially in the early weeks!
            </p>

            <p class="mbn-text">
                It usually takes from birth to around 6 weeks to establish your milk supply. During this time you should focus on making sure your baby is <a onclick="localSecJump('bf-114.html#1.1.4g');">attaching well</a>, and feed them for as long and as often as they seem <a onclick="localSecJump('sfp/sfp-514.html');">hungry</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                By about 6 weeks, your body will be getting used to making milk for your baby and you will find your breasts start to feel softer and less full than they used to. This is normal and does not mean your milk supply is reducing, it just means your breasts are getting good at giving milk on demand!

Your baby is far better at getting your milk out than a <a onclick="localSecJump('bf-1117.html#1.1.17h');">breast pump</a> and having your baby on your breast helps your body know how much milk to make.

            <ul>
                <li> softer or smaller breasts than in the early days and weeks - your breasts become very good at making milk on demand and so don't need to fill up like they did in the early days!

                <ul>
                    <li> wants to feed more than usual - there can be many reasons for this, including being thirstier in hot weather or during a growth spurt
                    </li>
                    <li> finishes feeds more quickly - older babies become experts at drinking milk and will usually finish in just a few minutes
                    </li>
                    <li> is unhappy, even after feeding - this might just be discomfort (e.g. teething) or illness (e.g. ear infection)
                    </li>
                    <li> goes through 'fussy' periods or 'hungry' days - these are normal and often occur around 5 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 4 months and 6 months
                    </li>
                    <li> gains less weight - this is common in breastfed babies at around 4 months (seek advice from a health professional if your baby is not <a onclick="localSecJump('sfp/sfp-515.html');">gaining weight)</a>

                <li> not enough feeding or feeds are too short - this means your baby may not be able to take enough milk to meet their needs and won't be signalling to your body to make more. This could happen if you are feeding strictly to a schedule or timing feeds.
                </li>
                <li> changing sides too quickly - it's best to let your baby decide when they have had enough on each breast

                <li> <b>poor attaching</b> or sucking - if your baby can't suck the milk out well, they might not get enough milk and will have fewer wet nappies - a <a onclick="localSecJump('bf-119.html#1.1.9j');">lactation consultant</a> can help with <a onclick="localSecJump('bf-114.html#1.14g');">proper attaching</a> and sucking techniques

                <li>using formula too often - giving your baby formula before you have set up your milk supply, when you are working, going out, or to 'top up' after breastfeeds will reduce your <a onclick="localSecJump('1.1.3');">milk supply</a>; giving extra breastfeeds can help avoid this
                </li>
                <li> introducing solids or <a onclick="localSecJump('solids/solids-416.html');">other fluids (like juice)</a> too soon - your baby will want less breastmilk and your supply will drop

                <ul>
                    <li> breastmilk gives your baby all the nutrition they need until they're around 6 months old

            <p class="mbn-text">
                Your milk supply responds to how much milk your baby is removing from the breast. When your baby removes milk from your breasts, this tells your body how much milk it needs to make.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                If you want to make more milk, there are lots of steps you can take. The first and most important step is to make sure your baby is <a onclick="localSecJump('bf-114.html#1.1.4g');">attaching</a> on and sucking well so that your breasts are being drained of their milk. If you're not sure about your baby's attachment, you can call the <a href="tel:1800686268">ABA helpline</a>, <a onclick="localSecJump('bf-119.html#1.1.9k');">midwife</a> or a <a onclick="localSecJump('bf-119.html#1.1.9j');">lactation consultant</a> for help. A lactation consultant can organise to see you and check whether your baby is removing the milk. If your baby is removing milk well, here are other steps you can take to make more milk:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> throw out routines for a few days and feed your baby more often than usual - even offering 'snack' feeds
                </li>
                <li> <a onclick="localSecJump('bf-1111.html');">express</a> any leftover milk after a feed - this stimulates your body to make more milk
                </li>
                <li> have more skin-to-skin contact and cuddle time with your baby
                </li>
                <li> keep your baby awake during a feed - <a onclick="localSecJump('sfp/sfp-519.html');">burp them</a>, change them, swap sides a few times during a feed
                </li>
                <li> squeeze a handful of breast and stroke towards the nipple while feeding to keep milk flowing into your baby's mouth
                </li>
                <li> avoid giving your baby a bottle or any other drink or food unless they are over six months and have <a onclick="localSecJump('solids/solids-411.html');">started solids</a> - make sure you ask for help to keep up your milk supply at the same time from the <a href="tel:1800686268">ABA helpline</a> or a <a onclick="localSecJump('bf-119.html#1.1.9j');">lactation consultant</a>

                <li> taking medicine (called a galactagogue) that increase milk supply whilst using some of the methods above to increase your milk supply - just remember that any medication (herbal or other) will have side effects that you will need to know about

                <b>Too much milk</b>
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                It takes your breasts about 6 weeks to adjust to making the right amount of milk for your baby. If you have too much milk after this time you might also have a strong <a onclick="localSecJump('bf-1111.html#1.1.11d');">let-down</a> and fast flow (when your milk comes out very fast!). If you find this upsets your baby, you can try:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> <a onclick="localSecJump('bf-1111.html');">expressing</a> to trigger your <a onclick="localSecJump('bf-1111.html#1.1.11d');">let-down reflex</a> and waiting till the milk flow slows down before putting your baby on your breast - you can just catch the milk with a cloth
                </li>
                <li> lying back to feed your baby - they will be working against gravity to suck 'uphill'
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mbn-text" id="1.1.3l">
                When you have too much milk you may need to <a onclick="localSecJump('sfp/sfp-519.html');">burp your baby</a> often and notice their poo looks green and frothy. If this is upsetting your baby you can also try to reduce your supply by taking these steps for a few days:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> feeding from just one breast at each feed
                </li>
                <li> comforting your baby in ways other than feeding (like rocking)
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mbn-text">
                Taking these steps will mean your breasts will feel full and hard at times. Remember to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> <a onclick="localSecJump('bf-1111.html');">express</a> just enough to make yourself comfortable again
                </li>
                <li> check every day for <a onclick="localSecJump('bf-118.html#1.1.8c');">blocked ducts, lumps or inflamed areas</a> in your breast tissue
                </li>
                <li> go back to a normal feeding pattern when your supply adjusts
                </li>
            </ul>

                This video answers common questions about breastfeeding. A <a onclick="localSecJump('bf-119.html#1.1.9j');">lactation consultant</a> says most mums can make plenty of milk for their baby. She talks about typical weight gain, and how to know whether your baby is getting enough milk.
