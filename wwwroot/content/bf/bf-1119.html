                <b>How can I feel more comfortable breastfeeding in public?</b>
                <br> It's normal to feel nervous at the thought of baring some skin in public, especially while you are still getting used to breastfeeding. What may surprise you is how little breast you actually show once your baby is <a onclick="localSecJump('bf-114.html#1.1.4g');">attached</a> and how few people even notice!
            </p>

                A breastfeeding mum usually looks like she is just holding her baby in a cradle position. Read up on some of the <a onclick="localSecJump('bf-116.html#1.1.6d');">tips to make it easier</a>
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                In Australia, you are protected by the law to breastfeed anywhere and at any time that you like - you never have to ask for permission.

            <p class="mbn-text" id="1.1.19c">

                <b>Will formula help my baby sleep longer?</b>
                <br> No - most babies wake through the night for the first few months. In fact, some research even shows that breastfeeding mums get more sleep, on average, than formula feeding mums because breastfeeding in the middle of the night is much quicker and easier than getting up to prepare a bottle!

                <b>Is breastfeeding supposed to hurt?</b>
                <br> As you get used to the strong sucking of your baby when you first start breastfeeding, your nipples might feel a bit sensitive and sore but it should never be painful. If this soreness doesn't go away after a week or so then something may not be right.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">

            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Breastfeeding should not be painful so make sure to ask for help if you need to. <a onclick="localSecJump('bf-119.html#1.1.9h');">Your GP,</a> <a onclick="localSecJump('bf-119.html#1.1.9i');">maternal and child health nurse</a>, a <a onclick="localSecJump('bf-119.html#1.1.9j');">lactation consultant</a> or the <a href="tel:1800686268">ABA helpline</a> are good places to start.

                <b>Will my breasts look different after breastfeeding?</b>
                <br> Breastfeeding does not cause saggy breasts. Instead, it is the pregnancy and weight loss that can bring on changes to your breasts' size and shape. As your breasts get bigger during pregnancy, the ligaments that support them can stretch - this happens whether or not you breastfeed your baby.
            </p>

            <p class="mbn-text" id="1.1.19h">
                When you stop breastfeeding you might feel like your breasts aren't as 'perky' as they were before but after about 6 months or so fatty tissue will slowly replace your milk-making tissue and leave them feeling fuller again.
            </p>

            <p class="mbn-text" id="1.1.19g">
                <b>My breasts feel soft - does this mean I have no milk?</b>
                <br> If your baby has been <a onclick="localSecJump('bf-114.html#1.1.4g');">attaching well</a> and you have been feeding them <a onclick="localSecJump('sfp/sfp-514.html');">whenever they are hungry</a>, your body adjusts to making the right amount of milk for your baby by about 6 weeks after birth.
            </p>

            <p class="mbn-text" id="1.1.19j">
                After this time, you may notice that your breasts start to feel softer and less full than they were and only feel fuller as the time for a feed gets closer, or if you miss a usual feed. This is normal and does not mean your milk supply is reducing, it just means your breasts are getting good at giving milk on demand!

                <br> Nipple confusion doesn't mean your baby is actually confused about your nipple or how to use it - it's just a description that is used for when babies don't want to breastfeed and find it easier to bottle feed (whether it is expressed breastmilk or formula).
            </p>

            <p class="mbn-text" id="1.1.19p">
                Bottles are very easy for a baby to feed from - they have a continuous flow of milk and your baby doesn't have to try very hard to get it out! When breastfeeding, babies need to work a bit harder - using about 40 different muscles in their face to suck the milk out.

                Once your <a onclick="localSecJump('bf-113.html');">milk supply</a> is established (usually around 6 weeks) and your baby is breastfeeding well, there is no reason why you can't give them the occasional <a onclick="localSecJump('bf-1110.html#1.1.10a');">bottle of expressed milk</a>.

                If you've given your baby bottles earlier than 4-6 weeks and they are reluctant to breastfeed, it doesn't mean they have forgotten how to or they are rejecting you, it just means they need to readjust to sucking for their milk.

            <p class="mbn-text">
                Babies exposed to cigarette smoke do get sick more often, and nicotine affects your breastmilk, but if you can't stop or even cut down on your smoking, it is still better to breastfeed your baby than to give them formula.

            <p class="mbn-text">
                Babies of mums who smoke are also more likely to suffer from the effects of the second-hand cigarette smoke if they are formula fed compared to if they are breastfed.

            <p class="mbn-text" id="1.1.19t">
                Although cigarette smoke increases a baby's risk of lung infections, asthma and sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI), breastmilk contains ingredients that help protect your baby from getting sick - more so than formula.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                That said, breastfeeding won't protect your baby completely and you should always take care to minimise the exposure of your baby to cigarette smoke.

                Minimise your baby being exposed to the harmful effects of smoking cigarettes by:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>timing your cigarettes for straight <i>after</i> a breastfeed - the longer the time between smoking and a breastfeed, the less nicotine your baby will be exposed to through your breastmilk
                </li>
                <li>keeping the area around your baby as smoke-free as possible:
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>never smoke in the house or the car
                    </li>
                    <li>don't allow anyone else to smoke near your baby
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>keeping as much smoke off you as possible - every time you have a cigarette, the smoke is trapped in your clothes, hair and skin - it's not practical to change your clothes, brush your teeth, shower and wash your hair after each cigarette, but every time you have a cigarette you could:
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>change into a 'smoking outfit' or something to cover your clothes, which you keep outside
                    </li>
                    <li>cover your hair with a shower cap or scarf
                    </li>
                    <li>wash your hands and brush your teeth when you have finished
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>quitting altogether - <a onclick="localSecJump('hs/hs-818.html');">get help to quit</a>

                <b>Should I switch to formula when I return to work?</b>
                <br> You don't have to switch to feeding your baby formula just because you are returning to work. Australian law protects your right to breastfeed or <a onclick="localSecJump('bf-1111.html');">express milk</a> at work.

            <p class="mbn-text" id="1.1.19w">
                Many mums continue to breastfeed their babies once they return to work and find that keeping that connection with their babies helps make the adjustment back to work a bit easier for both mum and baby.

                <b>My stored breastmilk smells and tastes different - is it off?</b>
                <br> The smell and taste of your breastmilk may have changed if it has been stored for a while but this doesn't necessarily mean it has 'gone off'! As long as you have <a onclick="localSecJump('bf-1111.html#1.1.11ab');">stored your breastmilk correctly</a>, it is perfectly safe to use.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                The changed taste and smell can happen because of the lipase (an enzyme) in your breastmilk which starts breaking down fats in the milk. You can stop this from happening by following <a onclick="localSecJump('bf-1111.html#1.1.11ag');">these steps</a>.
