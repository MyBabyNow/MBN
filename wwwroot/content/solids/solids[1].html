                 <b>Why wait until around 6 months to start solids?</b>
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                    For the first 6 months of your baby’s life, breastmilk or formula provide all of the nutrients your baby needs. Even once they have started solids, breastmilk or formula will still continue to be an important source of nutrients until your baby is at least 12 months.
            </p>  
            <p class="mbn-text">
                    Reasons why you should avoid introducing solids before 6 months:
                <ul>
                    <li><u>your baby's tummy is small</u> – starting solids too early can make your baby too full to have breastmilk/formula as well, making it more likely that they will miss out on the vital nutrients and energy (kilojoules/calories) they need to <a href="#5.1.5">grow</a> and develop properly
                    </li>
                    <li><u>your baby's body is still developing physically</u> – it cannot yet manage solid foods (such as being able to swallow different textured solids properly); if your baby pushes out any solid foods placed on their tongue, rather than this being a <a href="#4.1.12"><i>rejection of the food</i></a>, it’s actually a <i>natural reflex</i> to having objects in their mouth – this ‘extrusion reflex’ means they are not yet <a href="#4.1.1">ready for solids</a>, but the good news is that it normally disappears by 6 months of age
                    </li>   
                    <li><u>if you’re breastfeeding, it can affect your <a href="#1.1.3">milk supply</a></u> – giving your baby other foods and fluids can reduce the amount of breastmilk you make
                    </li> 
                    <li><u>it can upset your baby’s tummy</u> – solid foods are less sterile than breastmilk/formula and your because baby’s immune system is still maturing, increasing their exposure to pathogens in foods can cause upset tummies and/or diarrhoea
                    </li>  
                </ul>

                    <i><u>Truth:</u>night waking is common phase in babies around 3–4 months and is not related to the introduction of solids</i>

                    <i><u>Truth:</u> solids introduced before 6 months generally don’t improve growth as they tend to replace breastmilk/formula</i>

            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Even if your baby has been a good sleeper until now, it’s not uncommon for them to start waking up more at night once they reach 3–4 months of age.

                    This doesn’t always mean they are hungry – there <a href="#5.1.12">other reasons why babies this age start waking more at night</a> and starting solids before 6 months is unlikely to help.

            <p class="mbn-text">
                    It can be hard to start waking up throughout the night again but the good news is that there are things you can do to <a href="#5.1.12">encourage better sleep</a>

                   It is recommended that you <a href="#4.1.1">wait until 6 months</a> before introducing solid foods to your baby’s diet. This gives your baby’s body time to develop to a stage where it is ready to manage solids and ensures that they are still getting all the nutrition they need from breastmilk/formula.

            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Your baby’s first solid foods should be <a href="#4.1.9">high in iron</a>. This is because, from 6 months, your baby’s iron needs are greater than what your breastmilk or formula can provide.

             <p class="mbn-text">
                   The first thing to keep in mind is that <i>you provide</i> the food to your baby and <i>your baby decides</i> if they will eat it and if so, <i> <a href="#4.1.2">how much</a></i>. A good motto to remember is: <i> <a href="#4.1.10">parents provide, babies decide</a></i>.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Just like the rest of us, all babies are different, so some will enjoy solids faster than others will. At first, your baby will probably end up  <a href="#4.1.2">spitting most foods out</a>!
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Although messy, letting your baby explore their food with their fingers (including  <a href="#4.1.3">purées</a>) allows them to smell, feel and hopefully even taste new foods – it’s all part of the learning experience!

                <br>
                    To help you get started:
            </p>
             <ul>
                    <li> Until at least 8 months, start with offering solids twice a day <i>after</i> their normal breastmilk/formula feed so they still get the nutrients they need from the milk before filling up on solids.
                    </li>
                    <li> Sit at the same level as your baby and  <a href="#4.1.15">try not to fuss</a> – if they  <a href="#4.1.2">spit out</a> or  <a href="#4.1.12">refuse to accept the food</a>, just try again another time.
                    </li>   
                    <li> Offer solids when both you and your baby are happy and relaxed.
                    </li> 
                    <li> Allow your baby to sit with you when you are eating or at  <a href="#4.1.8">family meal times</a>, such as breakfast.
                    </li> 
                    <li> Over the first few weeks, gradually increase how often you offer solids.
                    </li> 
                </ul>

            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Just as a <a href="#4.1.2">variety of different foods</a> is important, so is a variety of age-appropriate textures. In the past, most babies had to stick to puréed foods for a longer time because they started solids before they were ready but when babies start solids at around 6 months, they can begin learning about other textures fairly quickly. Varying the food texture helps your baby learn to chew (even without teeth!) as well as to swallow.
            </p>
             <p class="mbn-text">
                   Start with <a href="#4.1.3">puréed or smooth food</a> and gradually progress to <a href="#4.1.3">lumpier foods</a> as soon as your baby tolerates it. These lumpier foods will help teach your baby how to chew their food (no teeth required) which then helps them to speak.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                  Generally, if your baby is:
                <ul>
                    <li> 6–8 months – use only <a href="#4.1.3">puréed and mashed foods</a> but move to <a href="#4.1.3">minced (or mashed with a fork) and chopped foods</a> soon
                    </li>
                    <li> 8 months – begin <a href="#4.1.4">finger foods</a>
                    </li>
                    <li> 12 months – your baby might even be ready to start eating foods with the same textures enjoyed by the <a href="#4.1.8">rest of the family</a>
                    </li> 
                </ul>
            </p> 

            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Just make sure you introduce <a href="#4.1.3">lumpy food</a> before your baby is 10 months of age to avoid feeding difficulties down the track, such as only accepting smooth or soft foods.

            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Just because your baby spits out new foods, it doesn’t always mean they don’t like them – they just need time to get used to them! In fact, it can take up to 10–15 tries of a new food before your baby may accept it – so try not to give up!
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   It is normal for babies to spit out new and unknown foods, <a href="#4.1.11">especially vegetables</a>, which tend to be less sweet and more bitter than other foods. It’s thought that because bitter tastes can be associated with poisons/toxins, this initial rejection of bitter foods is an instinctive reaction to protect against harm.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   If your baby spits out a food, the best thing to do is to try to <a href="#4.1.15">react calmly</a> and take the food away, before moving onto the next activity.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Resist the temptation to offer a <a href="#4.1.12">different food</a> as this can lead to food battles and <a href="#4.1.12">fussy eating</a> down the track!
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   As frustrating as spat out food can be, try to keep in mind that your baby needs time to explore the new <a href="#4.1.2">texture</a>/taste and they will take more in at each feed as they <a href="#5.1.5">grow</a> and get more used to solid food.

                   As well as different <a href="#4.1.2">types of foods</a>, a variety of textures helps teach your baby different skills such as chewing and swallowing, which also eventually helps them with speaking.

            <p class="mbn-text">
                   It takes time to learn how to manage different textures, so it’s important that the solids you offer are always prepared to a suitable consistency for your baby.

            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Start with <a href="#4.1.3">puréed/finely mashed</a> food before moving onto <a href="#4.1.2">lumpier food</a>, and <a href="#4.1.4">finger foods</a> (from 8 months).

            <p class="mbn-text">
                  Once your baby has mastered <a href="#4.1.3">puréed foods</a> (and is swallowing more than they are <a href="#4.1.3">spitting out</a>!) it's time to introduce lumpy food.

            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Instead of using a blender to purée the food, this time use a masher so the food is lumpier rather than completely smooth. This will help teach your baby how to chew their food and move their tongue. If you need to make the texture thinner, add some breastmilk, made up formula or boiled cooled water.

            <p class="mbn-text">
                   A good way to start is by mashing banana or avocado with a fork but don’t forget that your baby still needs <a href="#4.1.2">foods high in iron</a>.

            <p class="mbn-text">
                  Babies only tend to eat <a href="#4.1.3">small amounts</a> in a meal, so making extra food ahead of time is a great way of saving you valuable time and energy!
            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                    You can do this by:
                <ul>
                    <li>making extra at a meal or preparing a large batch of food
                    </li>
                    <li>freezing any extra food made (or leftovers not served) by putting 1–2 tablespoons of puréed/mashed food in separate blobs on a baking sheet and covering with cling film, or separating into: 
                    </li>       
                <ul>
                    <li>airtight containers
                    </li>
                    <li>ice cube trays sealed inside a plastic bag (e.g. snaplock bag)
                    </li> 
                </ul>  
                     <li>transferring the cubes/blobs to a plastic freezer bag once the food is frozen solid
                    </li> 
                    <li>labelling the freezer bag with the contents and date it was prepared – this is important because frozen baby food should be used within one month of freezing
                    </li>   
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                 When you’re ready to use frozen baby food, simply thaw the food in a closed container (not in an uncovered bowl) in the fridge.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                 If you need food ready more quickly, you can:
                <ul>
                    <li>fill a large bowl with hot water and put the cube/blob in a small bowl sitting in the hot water – it should be ready in 10–20 minutes
                    </li>
                    <li>use a microwave (as a last resort), making sure you stir the food well to avoid ‘hot spots’ that could burn your baby’s mouth or tongue
                    </li>

            <p class="mbn-text">
                    Finger foods are soft pieces of food, cut up into small pieces enough pieces so that they do not pose a <a href="#4.1.7">choking risk</a>, which babies can hold and try feeding to themselves.
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Giving your baby finger foods is a great way to encourage them to try, and eventually learn <i>how</i>, to feed themselves. Because it often creates a mess, it can be tempting to wait until they are older, but as soon as your baby has progressed to sucking and biting (usually by about 8 months) they will learn to manage finger foods.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Just be mindful to <b>never leave your baby alone while eating</b> – it does not take long for a baby to <a href="#4.1.7">choke</a> on something! <a href="#4.1.7">Gagging</a>, on the other hand, is common and is actually a good thing – read more about the differences between <a href="#4.1.7">choking and gagging</a>

                    <b>Baby-led weaning</b>
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   There has been some debate in recent years about the best way to start babies on solids, with the main ways being baby-led weaning (BLW) and traditional spoon-feeding.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   BLW is all about letting babies feed themselves and, given their developmental motor skills, this usually means they start by picking up chunks of food that they can chew. Traditional spoon-feeding involves <a href="#4.1.3">purées</a> and then moving onto chewable solids as the baby gets older.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                 The trend of BLW has progressed quickly and researchers are still studying whether we should be ‘dropping’ the spoon just yet. For example, it might be harder for babies following BLW to eat enough foods <a href="#4.1.2">high in iron</a> to prevent <a href="#4.1.9">iron</a> deficiency, which can delay brain development and may not be reversible.
            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   If you want to try BLW, make sure you still offer your baby <a href="#4.1.2">high iron foods</a> from the moment you start weaning, such as toast fingers topped with <a href="#4.1.16">iron fortified</a> baby cereal and strips of cooked red meat.
            </p>

            <p class="mbn-text">
                    Ready-made packaged baby foods <i>can</i> be nutritious, and are certainly very handy when you are short on time, but they also tend to be expensive and often contain extra, unwanted ingredients.
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Giving your baby finger foods is a great way to encourage them to try, and eventually learn <i>how</i>, to feed themselves. Because it often creates a mess, it can be tempting to wait until they are older, but as soon as your baby has progressed to sucking and biting (usually by about 8 months) they will learn to manage finger foods.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">  
                    Some of the problems with this are that:
                <ul>
                    <li><u>sweetness</u> encourages your baby to get a ‘sweet tooth’, which makes it harder to introduce other foods that aren’t as sweet, such as some <a href="#4.1.2">vegetables</a>
                    </li>
                    <li><u>smoothness</u> can make it harder to introduce other <a href="#4.1.16">textures</a>, such as those that are more <a href="#4.1.3">lumpy</a> and <a href="#4.1.4">chunky</a>
                    </li>
                    <li><u>mixture of different foods</u> doesn’t expose your baby to individual food tastes, which can promote <a href="#4.1.12">fussy eating</a> later on 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Think of bought baby foods like ‘takeaway foods’ – convenient to use now and again, such as when you’re out or short on time, but best not to use them too often.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                  The great news is that <a href="#4.1.3">making packaged baby foods at </a> is easy! Making your own packaged baby foods also saves you money and lets you decide exactly what you put in (or leave out), including <a href="#4.1.15">salt and sugar</a>.

            <p class="mbn-text">
                    Top tips for choosing baby foods at the shop:
                <ul>
                    <li>choose products that have the <i>lowest amount of sugar, sodium (salt) and saturated fat</i>
                    </li>
                     <ul>
                    <li>compare products using the <b>per 100g</b> or <b>per 100/mL</b> column on the <i>nutrition information panel</i> and choose those with the <i>lowest</i> values 
                    </li>
                    <li>you can also look in the <i>ingredients list</i> for added sugar and salt – the closer the ingredient is to the start of the list, the more of that ingredient there is in the product 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                     <li>go for items that are <a href="#4.1.2">high in iron</a> such as meat, fish, chicken, legumes or <a href="#4.1.16">iron fortified</a> baby cereal, especially if you use packaged foods every day 
                    </li>
                     <li>make sure the suggested age on the packet is suitable for your baby …but keep in mind that many baby foods will say <a href="#4.1.16">‘suitable from 4 months’</a> even though it’s recommended to <a href="#4.1.1">wait until around 6 months</a> to start solids, when most babies <a href="#4.1.1">are ready</a> 
                    </li>
                     <li>opt for whole foods that can be transported easily wherever possible, such as bananas, avocado or cheese sticks 
                    </li>
                     <li>yoghurt is a great option but always choose full fat <i><a href="#4.1.16">unsweetened</a></i> plain natural yoghurts to avoid lots of unnecessary added sugar – you can always add your own fruit later for extra sweetness if you want to! 
                    </li>
                     <li>double check that the food is <i>still in date</i> – if you plan on keeping the food for a little while before using it, check that the best before date won’t pass before you get to use it 
                    </li>
                     <li>not all packaged baby foods are on the shelf – you can find fresh baby meals in the freezer section too

                   The only drinks babies under 6 months need are formula or breastmilk, unless you have been advised otherwise by your GP or <a href="#8.1.2">maternal and child health nurse</a>. These provide them with all their nutrition needs as well as fluids to prevent dehydration.

            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Breastmilk or formula should still be your baby’s main drink in the first 12 months. A little cow's milk used <a href="#6.1.1">in cooking</a> is OK but it should not be their main drink. 
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Small amounts of cooled boiled water can be given from around 6 months if your baby needs extra fluids (e.g. in hot weather). Try not to give water too often because it can fill your baby's little tummy, making them feel too full to drink enough milk and they will risk not getting all the nutrition than need from milk/solids. 
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Once your baby has reached 6 months, it is also time to encourage your baby to drink (breastmilk, formula or cooled boiled water) <a href="#4.1.6">from a cup!</a>

            <p class="mbn-text">
                   From 12 months, until your baby is 2 years or older, regular full cream cow's milk is fine. By now, their main nutrition should be coming from <a href="#4.1.8">family meals</a> instead of milk. Avoid giving low and reduced fat cow's milk though – these do not contain enough energy (kilojoules/calories) for your baby’s rapidly <a href="#5.1.5">growing body.</a> 
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   It’s also best to serve any drinks <a href="#4.1.6">in a cup</a> (other than when breastfeeding) to help your baby learn to sip.

            </p>        
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   As adults, we enjoy many different drinks, so it can be tempting to offer your baby drinks other than just milk or water. However, the reality is that most other drinks can cause your baby harm, even if they appear to enjoy them.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                    For example, juices (including 100% fruit juice), soft drinks, cordials or sports and energy drinks can: 
                <ul>
                    <li>damage growing teeth – even before they have come through 
                    </li>
                    <li>cause your baby to <a href="#5.1.5">gain too much weight</a>, get tummy upsets and diarrhoea 
                    </li>
                    <li>fill up your baby’s tummy, leaving less room for more nutritious milks/foods needed for your baby’s <a href="#5.1.5">growth</a> and development 
                    </li>
                    <li>encourage your baby to develop a ‘sweet tooth’, making it <a href="#4.1.12">harder to introduce other foods</a> that aren’t as sweet, such as some <a href="#4.1.11">vegetables</a> 
                    </li>
                    <li>be harmful to your baby’s developing body if they contain high levels of caffeine, which is common with energy drinks

            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                    Coffee and teas (including herbal), like other drinks, can also fill up your baby’s small tummy (making them less hungry for milks/foods they need for growth and development) but they also should be avoided because they: 
                <ul>
                    <li>can prevent important nutrients (such as <a href="#4.1.9">iron</a>) being absorbed into your baby’s body properly

            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Because your baby is always watching you (and trying to copy what you do) they will see the drinks that you, your partner and other carers enjoy, and want to drink those too!  
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   If you regularly drink juice, soft drinks, cordials, sports drinks or energy drinks, now may be time to think about changing your own habits. An added bonus is that by <a href="#7.1.4">cutting back on these drinks</a>, you’ll save yourself money, <a href="#7.1.4">boost your own health</a> and probably lose weight at the same time!

            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Remember, you are your baby’s most important role model – your own drinking habits, as well as the drinks you keep at home, all play a big role in what your baby will want to drink themselves, especially as they get older. It’s important that you set a good example by not offering your baby these drinks, or making them available at home, to avoid a potential battle down the track.

                    <b>Introduce a sippy cup at 6 months of age</b>
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Once your baby reaches 6 months of age, it’s a good idea to start offering your baby’s drinks in a 'sippy' cup – a training cup that helps your baby learn how to sip. They’re usually made from plastic and have a lid with a spout that lets your baby drink without spilling.    
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   The aim is to introduce a cup at 6 months and if you’re bottle feeding, to phase out bottles altogether by 12 months.  
            </p>

            <p class="mbn-text" id="4.1.6h">
                    <b>Why a cup?</b>
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Using a cup increases the movement of your baby’s jaw and chin, which improves the coordination, control and flexibility of their tongue and lips – all of which are important in learning to talk!    
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   It also boosts your baby’s independence and improves their hand coordination

            <p class="mbn-text">
                    Things to look for when choosing a sippy cup: 
                <ul>
                    <li><u>clear/transparent material</u> so your baby can see the liquid inside 
                    </li>
                    <li><u>two handles</u> to make it easier for your baby to grip and pick up 
                    </li>
                    <li><u>free-flowing</u> that doesn’t have a non-spill valve – these valves make it harder for your baby to get the liquid out and encourages them to suck instead of sip 
                    </li>
                    <li><a>a soft bendable spout</ – this might be more familiar and acceptable than a hard plastic spout to start with 
                    </li>
                    <li>be harmful to your baby’s developing body if they contain high levels of caffeine, which is common with energy drinks 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   As soon as your baby is ready, you can move onto an open cup – most children can drink from an open cup by 2 years of age.

            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Your baby’s sippy cup should only ever contain cooled boiled water, breastmilk or formula. It should never contain <a href="#4.1.6">any other type of drink.</a>

                    Some tips to try:
                <ul>
                    <li><u>showing your baby how</u> to lift the cup to their mouth and tipping it up to drink
                    </li>
                    <li><u>letting your baby see you (or another child) drink from a clean sippy cup</u> – just make sure you always give your baby a clean cup – sharing cups without washing also shares bacteria from your mouth!

                <b>Choking versus gagging</b>
            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                    Babies often appear to cough and gag when they first try to swallow solid food – this is actually a good thing because the gag reflex is a safety mechanism that moves food from the back of the throat to the front, which helps prevent choking. 
            </p>        
            <p class="mbn-text">
                    A baby who is <a href="#4.1.7">gagging</a> might make some noise and seems to be coughing mildly. As long as your baby is breathing fine and manages to spit out the food themselves, there is no need to worry or try to help. 
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   A baby who is <a href="#4.1.7">choking</a> often can’t make much noise, if any at all. It is rare, but it doesn’t take long for a baby to choke (even on something small) and they may need your help. This is why it is so important to NEVER leave your baby alone while they are eating.  
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   A good motto to remember is: loud and red <a href="#4.1.7">(gagging)</a> let them go ahead, silent and blue <a href="#4.1.7">(choking)</a> they need <a href="#4.1.7">help from you</a>.

                    <li>If your baby is <a href="#4.1.7">gagging</a> on solids, try thinning the food with a little expressed breastmilk or formula and try again. Keep on offering <a href="#4.1.3">lumpy foods</a> every few days though, as it’s important for your baby to get used to <a href="#4.1.2">new textures</a>, and to learn how to chew and bite.  
                    </li>
                    <li>Try offering <a href="#4.1.4">finger foods</a> such as a piece of cooked broccoli or a finger of toast for your baby to play with and chew on – some babies don’t gag as much when they feed themselves finger foods. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Make sure your baby is sitting upright or leaning forward when eating – this lets your baby drop food out of their mouth without causing too many problems.  
                    </li>
                    <li>Feed you baby when they are calm and happy.  
                    </li>
                    <li>Stay with your baby at all times while eating. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Never give your baby small, hard or round foods like nuts, popcorn, marshmallows, or other lollies.

                   Babies can start having family foods from when you first introduce solids. The only major difference when they first start solids will be  <a href="#4.1.2">the texture</a>, which you will need to change according to what they can manage.

            <p class="mbn-text">
                   At first, you may need to  <a href="#4.1.3">mash or purée</a> their food but as their chewing improves, you can change the texture to <a href="#4.1.3">lumpier foods</a> and chopping up instead, as well as <a href="#4.1.4">finger foods</a>.

                  Babies and children need a range of nutrients to <a href="#5.1.5">grow</a> and develop to their full potential, most of which come from their foods and drinks.  
            </p>        
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   To make sure they get all these vital nutrients, it’s important to keep in mind that babies (and children) only have little tummies, which means they need to:
                 <ul>
                    <li>eat foods that are rich in nutrients – <a href="#4.1.15">’nutrient dense’ or everyday foods</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>avoid foods and drinks that fill them up quickly yet contain little nutrition – ’energy dense, nutrient poor’ or sometimes foods

                <b>Iron</b>
            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Iron is important for making sure your baby builds a healthy body and brain. Until around 6 months of age, your baby will get enough iron from breastmilk or formula but from 6 months, your baby needs more iron than your breastmilk or formula alone can provide. 
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   At 6 months your baby's main food should still be breastmilk/formula but this is why it's important to start introducing solids which are <a href="#4.1.2">high in iron</a> such as <a href="#4.1.16">iron fortified</a> baby cereals, finely mashed meat, fish, chicken, legumes (such as baked beans or lentils) and leafy green vegetables.
            </p>

                <b>Other nutritional needs </b>
            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   As long as your baby is being offered (and eating) a variety of different <a href="#4.1.2">healthy foods</a> and coloured fruit and <a href="#4.1.11">vegetable</a> <a href="#4.1.3">purées</a> as they start on solids, they should be getting all the nutrients they need. 
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Vitamin D, which is important for growing strong, healthy bones, is slightly different to the other nutrients. Although vitamin D can be found in oily fish and some fortified foods, the best source of vitamin D is the sun!  
            </p>
             <p class="mbn-text">
                   Your baby's skin actually <i>makes</i> vitamin D when in sunshine, which is a bonus because babies not only love being outdoors, but it also helps them to build healthy bones! 
            </p>
             <p class="mbn-text">
                   Just make sure your baby’s skin is <b>not exposed to sunshine for more than a few minutes at a time</b>, and never when UV levels are really high (such as in summer). This will help prevent burning, skin damage and later development of skin cancers. 
            </p>

            <p class="mbn-section" id="4.1.11" Solids> How to help your baby love vegetables!  </p>
            <p class="mbn-text" id="4.1.11a">

                  Vegetables are essential for good health and should make up a large part of the diet – for both babies and grown-ups! They provide a range of different vitamins and antioxidants, as well as lots of fibre and water, which are vital to your baby’s growth and development, and help to protect your baby’s body against all kinds of diseases. 
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                  In order to eat healthily, we need to eat many vegetables, ideally including a rainbow of different colours, in addition to a wide range of foods from the other four main food groups. 
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   The problem is that it often takes time for babies to learn to enjoy vegetables, largely because they tend to taste less sweet and more bitter than other foods. Bitter tastes can be associated with harmful substances such as poisons and toxins, so this initial rejection of bitter foods is thought to be an instinctive reaction to protect against harm. 
 
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   The good news is that you can help your baby to learn to like them, in fact, starting early is the best way to help your baby have a life-long liking (and hopefully love) of vegetables! 
            </p>

            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                <b>1. Offer vegetables early and often</b>
                <br>
                Babies who are offered vegetables every day, and from an early age, tend to continue this habit when they are older by eating a variety of different vegetables. 
            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text"> 
                Along with high iron foods, make sure you offer your baby a variety of different coloured vegetables as their first solid foods. To help your baby learn to like the taste of different individual vegetables, try not to always mix or hide them in other foods.  
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                <b>2. Keep offering rejected vegetables – but avoid food battles! </b>
                <br>
                Babies instinctively reject new foods – this is normal! In fact, it can take up to 10–15 tries of a new vegetable before your baby may learn to like it. The key is patience and persistence. 
            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text"> 
                When offering your baby a new vegetable, try not to make a fuss about the vegetable or pressure or bribe them to eat it. If they refuse to eat it, just take away the uneaten vegetable without comment.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text"> 
                If they try the vegetable but then spit it out, don’t make a fuss, just take away the uneaten food without comment. Consider this a win though – it still counts as a try! Try offering that vegetable again tomorrow or another day or perhaps prepared in a different way. 
            </p>
             <p class="mbn-text"> 
                Keep track of which vegetables you have offered (and your baby’s reaction!) with our vegetable tracker, and find out the best way to handle fussy eating.

            <p class="mbn-text">
                <b>3. Be a good role model – eat vegetables yourself! </b>
                <br>
                Your baby will naturally copy what you do and eating is no exception! If your baby sees you enjoying your own vegetables, they are more likely to learn to enjoy the vegetables you offer them.

                 <ul>
                    <li>breakfast might be: baked beans, cooked tomatoes and mushrooms, or perhaps spinach scramble or veggie omelette

                    <li>lunch could be: broccoli and polenta mash, cheesy leek and potato mash, dahl, eggy veg, mushroom carbonara, sweet potato and lentil soup, salmon and veggie couscous, cheesy spinach spaghetti or tuna & creamed corn macaroni 
                    </li>
                    <li>dinner could then be any of the recipes in the dinner section of our recipes section, such as savoury mince, vegetable stir-fry, fish and sweet potato mash, chicken Bolognese, lentil cottage pie, pumpkin, carrot and parsnip soup, zucchini pasta, sweetcorn and pea risotto or rainbow chips  
                    </li>
                    <li>snacks that boost vegetable intake throughout the day might be: hummus, steamed veggies, sweet potato wedges or any number of finger foods such as halved cherry tomatoes 
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <b>7. Offer vegetables prepared in different ways  </b>
                <br>
                Think about all the ways carrot can be prepared – steamed, roasted, raw, mashed, grated, stir-fried, chunks, puréed (etc!) – just because you might like carrot sticks when they’re raw but not when they’re roasted, doesn’t mean you dislike carrot altogether.
            <p class="mbn-text"> 
                Children are no different! Letting your baby try different vegetables, prepared in different ways, is a great way for them to experience the different flavours and textures that vegetables can have
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text"> 
                If your baby hasn’t liked a vegetable when cooked, you might try offering it raw (depending on the vegetable) and/or grated (but just be careful of choking hazards). 
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text"> 
                You could also try mixing vegetables into dishes with other ingredients but don’t be tempted to try and hide all the vegetables as this won’t let your baby try all their individual tastes and textures. 
            </p>

            <p class="mbn-text">
                <b>8. Let your baby play with well-cooked vegetables  </b>
                <br>
                Babies learn by watching and experimenting – this includes playing with their food! 
            <p class="mbn-text"> 
                A good way to let your baby explore new vegetables is to offer a few well-cooked pieces to play with in their high chair while you are preparing the rest of the meal.

            <p class="mbn-text"> 
                They might throw them around and make a bit of a mess but hopefully some of it might also end up in their mouth! It doesn’t matter too much because at the end of the day, it’s about letting them explore the new vegetable so they can become familiar with it.

                <br>
                The more positive, hands-on time a child has with vegetables, the more they will value and want to eat them. 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Some ways you could get your baby involved with vegetables include:

            </p>

                <b>10. Plan ahead  </b>
                <br>
                Offering your baby a variety of vegetable at most meals is hard if there are none in the fridge! Fresh vegetables don’t stay fresh forever, so having them on hand means you need to plan ahead.

                 Not all vegetables have to be fresh though! For example, many frozen vegetables (such as peas, sweetcorn, carrots and spinach) and some canned (such as beans, lentils and diced tomatoes) can be just as good as fresh – try keeping some of these in the cupboard for times when you haven’t been able to shop for fresh vegetables.

            <p class="mbn-text" id="4.1.12a">
                Fussy eating and food refusal is a normal, and very common, part of a child’s development. It’s a way of asserting their independence and both exploring their environment and pushing the boundaries to see if (and how often) they can get their own way. 
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Of course, as a parent who has carefully prepared a meal for your baby, it is hard not to feel frustrated when they then refuse to eat it! Take our feeding practices quiz for tips on how to feed your baby.

                If your baby is growing well then there is no need to worry but if you have any concerns about your baby's eating, make sure you talk to your GP or maternal and child health nurse.

            </p>  
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   It is normal for babies to spit out new and unknown foods (especially vegetables, which are often more bitter than other foods) but this doesn't always mean they don't like them – they just need time to get used to them, especially with all the different tastes and textures they’re now experiencing! 
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   It can actually take up to 10–15 tries of a new food before your baby may accept it – so try not to give up! The key is patience and persistence.

            </p>  
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   How you react to, and handle, food refusal is very important in avoiding meal time battles down the track! 
            </p>

            <p class="mbn-text" id="4.1.12d">
                  <b>Work out what could be causing the behaviour</b> 
            </p>  
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Your baby might refuse to eat the food you’re offering for a number of reasons! Knowing what your baby’s signs are will help you to work out why they are being fussy. 
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Some reasons for being fussy can be because they are:
                 <ul>
                    <li>too full to eat 
                    </li>
                    <li>starting or helping with growing a vegetable patch 
                    </li>
                    <li>not hungry
                    </li>
                    <li>tired
                    </li>
                    <li>distracted
                    </li>
                    <li>unwell 
                    </li>
                    <li>teething 
                    </li>
                    <li>not ready for solids yet. 
                    </li>
                    <li>just testing you out to see what they can get away with! 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p> 
        <p class="mbn-text">
                   Try:
            <ul>
                    <li>reducing (or stopping) your baby from ‘grazing’ between meals and snacks – grazing fills your baby up, often making them too full to try new foods at meal and snack times 
                    </li>
                    <li>only offering breastmilk/formula after eating solids once your baby has reached 8 months – this should make sure your baby hungry enough to try new foods 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p> 
           <p class="mbn-text">
                  Don’t forget that it is normal for your baby’s appetite to change from day-to-day – they might eat lots one day and very little the next! 
            </p>

            <p class="mbn-text" id="4.1.12e">
                  <b>Don't give them alternative foods</b> 
            </p>  
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   When your baby refuses a meal/snack it can be tempting to give in and offer them something you know they will eat. The problem is that this only reinforces their behaviour as OK, teaching them to refuse more food in the future so they can get what they want. 
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Instead, just take the food away and move onto the next activity. Try not to offer a different food until the next planned meal or snack time. 
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Don’t worry, your baby will not starve themselves! They will eat when they are hungry and probably just eat more at the next meal or snack time if they need it. But if you are worried they won’t sleep well, you could also try offering a milk feed closer to bedtime to tide them over. 
            </p>

             <p class="mbn-text" id="4.1.12f">
                  <b>Keep trying!</b> 
            </p>  
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   It’s easy to fall into the trap of labelling a food refusal as a dislike of that food but just keep in mind that it can take up to 10–15 tries of a new food before your baby may accept it.   
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Try:
                 <ul>
                    <li>changing the way you talk about the food – your baby will pick up on how you talk about foods, especially as they get older and saying they “don’t like it” doesn’t help in your attempts to get them to try the food! As an example, instead of saying “Sienna doesn’t like green beans”, you might say “Sienna is still getting used to green beans” 
                    </li>
                    <li>not to fuss or give up, just try offering the food again another time, maybe even prepared in a different way 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p> 

            <p class="mbn-text" id="4.1.12g">
                  <b>Try not to fuss, bribe or pressure your baby to eat</b> 
            </p>  
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   The more you fuss and try to control what your baby eats, the more <i>they</i> will fuss and continue to refuse the food. It becomes more about the power struggle than the food.  
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                 Bribing your baby to eat a food (e.g. “eat your vegetables and you can have dessert”) only ends up making the reward food (in this case, the dessert) something your baby really wants, and the food you’re trying to get them to eat (in this case, the vegetables) less desirable. It doesn’t help your baby learn to like new foods and if anything, only that they must ‘endure’ them to get what they <i>really</i> want. 
            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                 Instead, if your baby has refused a food or meal, simply take it away, without comment or fuss, and remain calm. Don’t offer a different food. By not giving into their fussy eating now, you will be avoiding many food battles when they get older! 
            </p> 

            <p class="mbn-text" id="4.1.12h">
                  <b>Limit the length of meal times</b>

            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Keep your stress levels down by having meal time routine and not letting meal times drag on for ages.   
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                 Try to keep meal times to just 15–20 minutes. This helps your baby learn that when meal time is (and isn’t) and that food will not be offered outside of these times. Your baby will eat when they are hungry – they won’t starve themselves!

            <p class="mbn-text">
                   One of the best ways to encourage your baby to eat healthy foods is by eating and enjoying them yourself!   
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                 And just because you don’t like a particular food or perhaps love another food, this doesn’t mean that your baby will be the same. Try to let your baby try a variety of healthy foods so they can work out what they like (and don’t like) themselves.

                   <b>We</b> might like to see our plates full, but babies and toddlers can feel a bit overwhelmed when they’re given large amounts of food.  
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                 Instead, it’s better to only offer small serves and give more later, if needed. This way, you shouldn’t end up wasting too much food (which can be frustrating!) or forcing your baby to finish all the food offered, which can lead to excess weight gain if they’re eating more than they feel they need.  
            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                 Don’t forget, the amount of food your baby will eat will also change from day-to-day.

                   To lower the risk of your baby developing allergies: 
                 <ul>
                    <li>start introducing solids at around 6 months
                    </li>
                    <li>offer your baby any new solids first thing in the morning so you can watch for any reactions over the day
                    </li>
                    <li>continue breast/formula feeding your baby while introducing solids – milk is still their main meal and provides them with almost all the vital nutrients they need until 12 months 
                    </li>
                    <li>introduce foods commonly associated with allergies (such as cooked egg, nut spreads like peanut butter, dairy, fish and wheat) in the first 12 months – even if your baby has a high risk of developing food allergies 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   There is no need to introduce new foods slowly or one at a time – several can be introduced at once. Just try not to always serve new foods as part of a mixture, as this doesn’t let your baby try all the individual tastes and textures that foods can have.

                  As you introduce your baby to a variety of new healthy foods you can expect your baby's poo to change in colour, smell and texture. Try not to get too worried about your baby's bowel habits – as long as your baby is gaining weight and appears happy, the poo changes are probably normal!

                  Constipation is when your baby's poo is hard and dry (and looks like marbles) – it is more common around the time solids are introduced. The number of poos a day can vary considerably from one baby to another; some babies have only one poo a week while others have several poos a day, but both are normal.

                   There are a couple of signs that your baby might be constipated:
                 <ul>
                    <li>they seem to be in pain or is distressed when pooing (a little straining no cause for concern)

            <p class="mbn-text">
                   To relieve/prevent your baby from being constipated:
                 <ul>
                    <li><u>introduce solids slowly</u> – start with ½ a teaspoon a couple of times per day after their usual breastmilk or formula feed and increase gradually

                     <li class="mbn-ol">1. <u>Prune juice</u> contains a natural bowel irritant and should never be given to babies under 9 months of age, even when diluted.

                     <li class="mbn-ol">2. <u>Adding anything extra to formula</u> such as any form of sugar, malt extract or chocolate powders like Milo or Nesquick or rice cereal to formula – always follow the manufacturer’s instructions.
                    </li>
                     <li class="mbn-ol">3. <u>Introducing solids too early</u> – starting your baby on solids before 4 months is unsafe for your baby.

            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Even though it is recommended that solids are introduced from around 6 months, breastmilk or formula are still important sources of nutrients for your baby until at least 12 months. The only thing that changes is which is offered first – milk or solids.

                   After 12 months, replacing formula with regular full cream cow's milk is fine – not low and reduced fat though, as these do not have enough energy (kilojoules/calories) for your baby’s rapidly growing body. By now, your baby’s main nutrition should be coming from family meals instead of milk.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Cow’s milk should not be given before 12 months as it does not contain enough iron and can overwork your baby’s kidneys, which are still developing.

            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Breastmilk is the normal food for babies. Many mums worry that they don't have enough milk but every time you breastfeed your baby (or <a href="#1.1.11">express milk</a>), messages between your brain and breasts signal your body to make more milk to build up your <a href="#1.1.3">milk supply</a>.
            </p>

            <p class="mbn-text">
                   It usually takes from birth to 6 weeks to establish your milk supply. By then, your body should be used to making milk for your baby and you will find your breasts start to feel softer and less full than they used to. This is normal and does not mean your milk supply is reducing, it just means your breasts are getting good at giving milk on demand!

                   Any regular replacement of a breastfeed (even just once a day) will affect your milk supply because <a href="#3.1.3">milk supply</a> responds to the demand from your baby. One way to keep up your milk supply is to fit in some extra <a href="#1.1.11">expression sessions</a>.

                   Some babies adjust to feeding from a bottle very quickly, while others need a bit of time. All babies are adaptable and can learn to feed from both the breast and from a bottle.

             <p class="mbn-text">
                   While your baby is getting used to being fed from a bottle, it may be easier for somebody else to feed them. Your baby can smell your breastmilk and may refuse the bottle and/or formula if your breasts are close by!
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Once your baby is used to feeding from a bottle, use this time as important cuddling and bonding time as usual.

Once your baby has reached 12 months, they can then have <a href="#4.1.6">regular full cream cow's milk</a> as their drink instead. Babies do not need follow-on formulas or toddler milks.

                     It is likely that by regularly giving your baby formula, your <a href="#3.1.3">milk supply</a> will be affected. Your body responds to your baby's demand for milk, so if they are feeding less from the breast, then your body will make less milk. This is one of the reasons why it's important to be clear in your decision about <a href="#3.1.2a">why you want to mix feed</a> and how you will do it.
            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                     Remember, many mums worry they don't make enough milk for their baby, but this is unlikely if you have been feeding your baby whenever they are <a href="#5.1.4">hungry</a> and they are <a href="#1.1.4g">attached on properly</a>. If your baby is unsettled it may not be because they're hungry!

                     The amount of formula you give your baby will depend on your <a href="#3.1.5">reasons for giving it</a>. Remember, any regular replacement of a breastmilk will lead to a reduction in your <a href="#3.1.3">milk supply</a> (your body gets used to making less breastmilk because your baby is removing less).
            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                    If you are given specific advice from a health professional on how much formula to give – you should follow that advice.

                    If you want to keep up your <a href="#3.1.3">milk supply</a> while also giving formula, be sure to:
                <ul>
                    <li>always breastfeed <i>before</i> offering the bottle
                    <li>avoid giving your baby formula between breastfeeds as this might make them too full to have a big breastfeed which can then start a cycle of reducing demand on your <a href="#3.1.3">milk supply</a>
                    </li> 
                    <li>start slowly and with small amounts of formula – the average 4kg baby that is being exclusively formula-fed will only have around 100mL at each formula feed, so start with much less than this

                <b>What texture is right for my baby?</b>
                <br /> Just as a variety of different foods is important, so is a variety of age-appropriate textures. Varying the food texture helps your baby learn to chew (even if they don't yet have teeth!) as well as swallow.

                    <li>
                        <u>6 - 8 months</u> - use only pur&eacute;ed and mashed foods but move to minced (or mashed with a fork) and chopped foods soon
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>8 months</u> - begin <a href="#4.4.1">finger foods</a>.

                    <li>
                        <u>12 months</u> - your baby can eat the variety of foods eaten by the rest of the family

            <p class="mbn-section" id="6.6.1b">Milk</p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                The type of milk your baby should have depends on their age. Breastmilk or formula provides all the nutrition your baby needs up to around 6 months. The following guidelines should be followed unless your GP or maternal and child health nurse advises you otherwise:
                <ul>
                    <li> from 8 months, offer your baby breastmilk/formula after solids meals to make sure they are hungry enough to eat the new iron rich foods they now need
                    </li>
                    <li> from 6 months, if you are formula feeding, you may wish to offer formula in a sippy cup rather than a bottle.
                    </li>
                    <li> cow's milk should not be given as a drink until your baby is older than 12 months but small quantities used in cooking are OK
                    </li>
                    <li>until your baby is 2 years or older, always provide regular full cream cow's milk (instead of low/reduced fat cow's milk as this doesn't contain enough energy for your growing baby)
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p class="mbn-section" id="6.6.1c">Water</p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If your baby is under 6 months old, they will get all the hydration they need from breastmilk/formula (even in hot weather) and should not be given water.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        From 6 months it is OK to give your baby small sips of cooled boiled tap water if they seem thirsty (e.g. in hot weather) but this shouldn't be done regularly as it can fill your baby's little tummy, making them feel too full to drink enough milk to get the energy they need to grow.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It's a good idea to encourage your baby to drink (milk, or water if having) from a cup after 6 months of age!

            <p class="mbn-section" id="6.6.1d">Fruit juice</p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Fruit juice should not form part of your baby's diet for a few reasons:
                <ul>
                    <li> compared with the whole fruit, it's far easier to drink too much which can cause your baby to gain too much weight
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> it takes about 3 whole oranges to make just 1 cup of orange juice
                        </li>
                        <li> there is no chewing involved, so it can be swallowed quickly
                        </li>
                        <li>most of the fibre is lost so it passes through more quickly
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li> too much can cause diarrhoea
                    </li>
                    <li> the natural sugars can cause tooth decay - even before the teeth have come through
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p class="mbn-section" id="6.6.1e">Cordial / fizzy drinks / soft-drinks / energy drinks</p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Cordials, fizzy drinks, soft-drinks and energy drinks should never be given to your baby as they can damage growing teeth and cause your baby to gain too much weight. Energy drinks also contain high levels of caffeine which can be harmful to your baby's developing body.
