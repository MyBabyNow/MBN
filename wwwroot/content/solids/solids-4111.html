            <p class="mbn-text" id="4.1.11a">

                Vegetables are essential for good health and should make up a large part of the diet - for both babies and <a onclick="localSecJump('parents/parents-714.html#7.1.4e');">grown-ups</a>! They provide a range of different vitamins and antioxidants, as well as lots of fibre and water, which are vital to your baby's <a onclick="localSecJump('sfp/sfp-515.html#5.1.5');">growth</a> and development, and help to protect your baby's body against all kinds of diseases.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                In order to eat healthily, we need to eat many vegetables, ideally including a rainbow of different colours, in addition to a wide range of foods from the other four <a onclick="localSecJump('parents/parents-714.html#7.1.4d');">main food groups</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                The problem is that it often takes time for babies to learn to <i>enjoy</i> vegetables, largely because they tend to taste less sweet and more bitter than other foods. Bitter tastes can be associated with harmful substances such as poisons and toxins, so this initial rejection of bitter foods is thought to be an instinctive reaction to protect against harm.

            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                The good news is that you can help your baby to learn to like them, in fact, <b>starting early is the best way</b> to help your baby have a life-long liking (and hopefully love) of vegetables!

            <p class="mbn-text">
                <b>1. Offer vegetables early and often</b>
                <br> Babies who are offered vegetables every day, and from an early age, tend to continue this habit when they are older by eating a variety of different vegetables.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Along with <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-412.html#4.1.2d');">high iron foods</a>, make sure you offer your baby a variety of different coloured vegetables as their first solid foods. To help your baby learn to like the taste of different individual vegetables, try not to always mix or hide them in other foods.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                <b>2. Keep offering rejected vegetables - but avoid food battles! </b>
                <br> Babies instinctively reject new foods - this is normal! In fact, it can take up to 10-15 tries of a new vegetable before your baby may learn to like it. The key is patience and persistence.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                When offering your baby a new vegetable, try not to make a fuss about the vegetable or <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-4112.html#4.1.12i');">pressure or bribe them</a> to eat it. If they refuse to eat it, just take away the uneaten vegetable without comment.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                If they try the vegetable but then <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-412.html#4.1.2m');">spit it out</a>, <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-4115.html#44.1.15j');">don't make a fuss</a>, just take away the uneaten food without comment. Consider this a win though - it still counts as a try! Try offering that vegetable again tomorrow or another day or perhaps prepared in a different way.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Keep track of which vegetables you have offered (and your baby's reaction!) with our <a href="tool:Link to vegetable tracker">vegetable tracker</a>, and find out the best way to <a onclick="localSecJump(solids-4112.html#4'4.1.12');">handle fussy eating</a>.

                <b>3. Be a good role model - eat vegetables yourself! </b>
                <br> Your baby will naturally copy what you do and eating is no exception! If your baby sees you <a onclick="localSecJump('parents/parents-714.html#7.1.4b');">enjoying your <i>own</i> vegetables</a>, they are more likely to learn to enjoy the vegetables you offer <i>them</i>.

                <b>5. Introduce new vegetables with foods your baby likes  </b>

            <p class="mbn-text">
                <b>6. Offer many different types of vegetables  </b>
                <br> Nutritionally this is great, but by offering several types of vegetable in each meal, as well as a variety of different vegetables at each <i>different</i> meal, babies tend to eat more vegetables <i>overall</i>.

            </p>

            <p class="mbn-text">
                <b>7. Offer vegetables prepared in different ways  </b>
                <br> Think about all the ways carrot can be prepared - steamed, roasted, raw, mashed, grated, stir-fried, chunks, <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-413.html#4.1.3h');">pur&eacute;ed</a> (etc!) - just because you might like carrot sticks when they're raw but not when they're roasted, doesn't mean you dislike carrot altogether.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Children are no different! Letting your baby try different vegetables, prepared in different ways, is a great way for them to experience the different flavours and <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-412.html#4.1.2h');">textures</a> that vegetables can have.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                If your baby hasn't liked a vegetable when cooked, you might try offering it raw (depending on the vegetable) and/or grated (but just be careful of <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-417.html#4.1.7a');">choking hazards</a>).
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                You could also try mixing vegetables into dishes with other ingredients but don't be tempted to try and hide all the vegetables as this won't let your baby try all their individual tastes and textures.
            </p>

            <p class="mbn-text">
                <b>8. Let your baby play with well-cooked vegetables  </b>
                <br> Babies learn by watching and experimenting - this includes playing with their food!
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                A good way to let your baby explore new vegetables is to offer <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-414.html#4.1.4a');">a few well-cooked pieces</a> to play with in their high chair while you are preparing the rest of the meal.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                They might throw them around and make a bit of a mess but hopefully some of it might also end up in their mouth! It doesn't matter too much because at the end of the day, it's about letting them explore the new vegetable so they can become familiar with it.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                <b>9. As your baby gets older, get them involved with all things vegetables!  </b>
                <br> The more positive, hands-on time a child has with vegetables, the more they will value and want to eat them.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Some ways you could get your baby involved with vegetables include:

            <ul>
                <li>helping to choose which vegetables to buy
                </li>
                <li>starting or helping with growing a vegetable patch
                </li>
                <li>getting hand-on in the kitchen by helping to prepare the vegetables
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                This all helps your child become interested in, and familiar with, vegetables.

            <p class="mbn-text">
                <b>10. Plan ahead  </b>
                <br> Offering your baby a variety of vegetable at most meals is hard if there are none in the fridge! Fresh vegetables don't stay fresh forever, so having them on hand means you need to <a onclick="localSecJump('parents/parents-716.html#7.1.6r');">plan ahead</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Not all vegetables have to be fresh though! For example, many frozen vegetables (such as peas, sweetcorn, carrots and spinach) and some canned (such as beans, lentils and diced tomatoes) can be just as good as fresh - try keeping some of these in the cupboard for times when you haven't been able to shop for fresh vegetables.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Getting your baby to like vegetables might be a trying process at times but it is worth it - don't give up - and remember, <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-4112.html#4.1.12i');">pressuring or manipulating</a> your baby to eat vegetables doesn't work and can actually result in your baby eating less vegetables.
