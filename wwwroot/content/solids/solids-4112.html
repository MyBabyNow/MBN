            <p class="mbn-text" id="4.1.12a">
                Fussy eating and food refusal is a normal, and very common, part of a child's development. It's a way of asserting their independence and both exploring their environment and pushing the boundaries to see if (and how often) they can get their own way. 
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Of course, as a parent who has carefully prepared a meal for your baby, it is hard not to feel frustrated when they then refuse to eat it! Take our <a href="#Link to feeding practices quiz">feeding practices quiz</a> for tips on how to feed your baby.  
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                If your baby is <a href="#5.1.5">growing well</a> then there is no need to worry but if you have any concerns about your baby's eating, make sure you talk to your GP or <a href="#8.1.2">maternal and child health nurse</a>. 
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                This video talks about why babies cause a fuss, how giving into what they want reinforces this fussy behaviour as OK, and the best way to make sure that you give your baby the right message.

                  <b>Why babies reject new foods</b>
            </p>  
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   It is normal for babies to <a href="#4.1.2">spit out</a> new and unknown foods (especially <a href="#4.1.11">vegetables</a>, which are often more bitter than other foods) but this doesn't always mean they don't like them - they just need time to get used to them, especially with all the different tastes and <a href="#4.1.2">textures</a> they're now experiencing! 
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   It can actually take up to 10-15 tries of a new food before your baby may accept it - so try not to give up! The key is patience and persistence. 
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   If getting your baby to eat vegetables is the main problem, make sure you check out our <a href="#4.1.11">top tips to helping your baby like them</a> and don't forget to keep track of which vegetables you have offered (and your baby's reaction!) with our <a href="#Link to vegetable tracker">vegetable tracker!</a>

                  <b>Tips to manage fussy eating</b>
            </p>  
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   How you react to, and handle, food refusal is very important in avoiding meal time battles down the track! 
            </p>

            <p class="mbn-text" id="4.1.12d">
                  <b>Work out what could be causing the behaviour</b> 
            </p>  
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Your baby might refuse to eat the food you're offering for a number of reasons! Knowing what your baby's signs are will help you to work out why they are being fussy. 
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Some reasons for being fussy can be because they are:
                 <ul>
                    <li><a href="#4.1.2">too full</a> to eat 
                    </li>
                    <li>starting or helping with growing a vegetable patch 
                    </li>
                    <li>not <a href="#4.1.2">hungry</a>
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="#5.1.6">tired</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>distracted
                    </li>
                    <li>unwell 
                    </li>
                    <li>teething 
                    </li>
                    <li>not <a href="#4.1.1">ready for solids</a> yet. 
                    </li>
                    <li>just testing you out to see what they can get away with! 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Try:
                <ul>
                    <li>reducing (or stopping) your baby from 'grazing' between meals and snacks - grazing fills your baby up, often making them too full to try new foods at meal and snack times 
                    </li>
                    <li>only offering breastmilk/formula <i>after</i> eating solids once your baby has reached 8 months - this should make sure your baby hungry enough to try new foods 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                  Don't forget that it is normal for your baby's <a href="#4.1.15">appetite</a> to change from day-to-day - they might eat lots one day and very little the next! 
            </p>

            <p class="mbn-text" id="4.1.12e">
                  <b>Don't give them alternative foods</b> 
            </p>  
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   When your baby refuses a meal/snack it can be tempting to give in and offer them something you know they will eat. The problem is that this only reinforces their behaviour as OK, teaching them to refuse more food in the future so they can get what they want. 
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Instead, just take the food away and move onto the next activity. Try not to offer a different food until the next planned meal or snack time. 
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Don't worry, your baby will not starve themselves! They will eat when they are  <a href="#4.1.2">hungry</a> and probably just eat more at the next meal or snack time  <a href="#4.1.15">if they need it</a>. But if you are worried they won't sleep well, you could also try offering a milk feed closer to bedtime to tide them over. 
            </p>

            <p class="mbn-text" id="4.1.12f">
                  <b>Keep trying!</b> 
            </p>  
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   It's easy to fall into the trap of labelling a food refusal as a <i>dislike</i> of that food but just keep in mind that it can take up to 10-15 tries of a new food before your baby may accept it.   
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Try:
                <ul>
                    <li>changing the way you <i>talk</i> about the food - your baby will pick up on how you talk about foods, especially as they get older and saying they "don't like it" doesn't help in your attempts to get them to try the food! As an example, instead of saying "Sienna doesn't like green beans", you might say "Sienna is still getting used to green beans" 
                    </li>
                    <li>not to fuss or give up, just try offering the food again another time, maybe even prepared in a different way 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p> 

            <p class="mbn-text" id="4.1.12g">
                  <b>Try not to fuss, bribe or pressure your baby to eat</b> 
            </p>  
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   The more you fuss and try to control what your baby eats, the more <i>they</i> will fuss and continue to refuse the food. It becomes more about the power struggle than the food.  
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                 Bribing your baby to eat a food (e.g. "eat your vegetables and you can have dessert") only ends up making the  <a href="#4.1.15">reward food</a> (in this case, the dessert) something your baby really wants, and the food you're trying to get them to eat (in this case, the  <a href="#4.1.11">vegetables</a>) less desirable. It doesn't help your baby learn to like new foods and if anything, only that they must 'endure' them to get what they <i>really</i> want. 
            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                 Instead, if your baby has refused a food or meal, simply take it away, without comment or fuss, and remain calm. Don't offer a  <a href="#4.1.12">different food</a>. By not giving into their fussy eating now, you will be avoiding many food battles when they get older! 
            </p> 

            <p class="mbn-text" id="4.1.12h">
                  <b>Limit the length of meal times</b> 
            </p>  
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Keep your stress levels down by having  <a href="#4.1.8">meal time routine</a> and not letting meal times drag on for ages.   
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                 Try to keep meal times to just 15-20 minutes. This helps your baby learn that when meal time is (and isn't) and that food will not be offered outside of these times. Your baby will eat when they are  <a href="#4.1.2">hungry</a> - they won't starve themselves! 
            </p> 

            <p class="mbn-text" id="4.1.12i">
                  <b>Be a  <a href="#4.1.8">healthy role model</a></b> 
            </p>  
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   One of the best ways to encourage your baby to eat  <a href="#4.1.2">healthy foods</a> is by  <a href="#7.1.4">eating and enjoying them yourself</a>!   
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                 And just because you don't like a particular food or perhaps love another food, this doesn't mean that your baby will be the same. Try to let your baby try  <a href="#4.1.2">a variety of healthy foods</a> so they can work out what they like (and don't like) themselves.  
            </p> 

            <p class="mbn-text" id="4.1.12j">
                  <b>Only offer small amounts at a time </b>

            <p class="mbn-text">
                   <b>We</b> might like to see our plates full, but babies and toddlers can feel a bit overwhelmed when they're given large amounts of food.  
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                 Instead, it's better to only offer small serves and give more later, if needed. This way, you shouldn't end up wasting too much food (which can be frustrating!) or  <a href="#4.1.15">forcing your baby to finish all the food offered</a>, which can lead to  <a href="#5.1.5">excess weight gain</a> if they're eating more than they feel they need.  
            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                 Don't forget, the amount of food your baby will eat will also change from day-to-day.

            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Babies are more likely to try a new food when they are served with something they like or are already familiar with.

                 If your baby initially refuses to try a new food, next time, try serving it with a food your baby is already familiar with or really likes.
