                  Babies and young children are very good at knowing <a href="#4.1.15">how much food they need to eat</a> (which is something we adults are generally not very good at!); your baby will eat when they need to and won't try to starve themselves!

                    <b>My family is worried that my baby is not very plump. Is this a sign that I should start feeding them solids before 6 months?</b> 
            </p> 
             <p class="mbn-text">
                  Until your baby is 6 months old, milk (breastmilk or formula) is far more nutritionally beneficial for them than solids - it contains all the fluid, energy (kilojoules/calories) and nutrition that your baby needs. Even after 6 months, milk is still a very important part of your baby's diet, although by then, they will also need a variety of <a href="#4.1.2">healthy solids</a> as well.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   By starting your baby on solids before 6 months, their small tummy will likely make them less hungry for milk. As a result, they will end up getting less nutrients and energy than they were before solids were introduced. This is just one of the reasons that you should <a href="#4.1.1">wait until 6 months</a> before introducing solids.
            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                  Your baby will let you know when they're <a href="#4.1.1">ready for solids</a> but you can also check by <a href="#Link to 'is your baby ready for solids">taking our quiz</a>. If you are worried that <a href="#5.1.5">your baby's growth</a> is not tracking well, make sure you speak to your GP or your <a href="#8.1.2">maternal and child health nurse</a>.

            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   The good news is that this is usually just a phase that many babies go through around 3-4 months of age, even if they have been good sleepers until then.

            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                  A variety of  <a href="#4.1.2">healthy homemade food</a> is definitely a good move for your baby as they can get a taste of foods eaten at home. That said, jars, cans, and packets of  <a href="#4.1.5">packaged baby food</a> can be really helpful when you are out and about!
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Ready-made packaged baby foods can be nutritious (learn  <a href="#4.1.5">how to choose the best ones</a>), but they also tend to be expensive and often contain extra, unwanted ingredients. They are fine to use now and again but try  <a href="#4.1.3">packing food from home</a> wherever possible.
            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                 Don't forget that until your baby reaches 12 months, breastmilk/formula is still their main source of nutrition.

                    <b>What does 'iron fortified' mean and how can I tell if a baby cereal is fortified?</b> 
            </p>   
            <p class="mbn-text">
                 'Iron fortified' means that the food has had extra  <a href="#4.1.9">iron</a> added to it.
            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                 From around 6 months your baby needs nutrients, such as  <a href="#4.1.9">iron</a>, that breastmilk/formula alone can't provide. This is why they need to start eating  <a href="#4.1.2">iron rich</a> solid foods, such as meat, fish, chicken, legumes or iron fortified foods such as iron fortified baby cereals.
            </p> 

            <p class="mbn-text">
                  To check if the baby rice cereal is iron fortified, follow these simple steps:
                 <ul>
                    <li>turn the package to the side where the Nutrition Information Panel (a table) is
                    </li>
                    <li>look for iron on the left hand column
                    </li>
                    <li>follow your finger across and look at the amount of iron in the 'per 100g' column - this lets you compare the amount of iron in different products
                    </li>
                </ul>  
            </p> 
             <p class="mbn-text">
                 <b>Note:</b> the instructions on the packet will advise how much you should give your baby and how to make it; the amount of iron in each brand of baby rice cereal may be different, so don't forget to check the packet!

                   Try not to get too worried about your baby's bowel habits - as long as your baby is  <a href="#5.1.5">gaining weight</a> and appears happy, the poo changes are probably normal!

                    When your baby first starts solids, it's more to start experiencing foods (tastes/ <a href="#4.1.2">textures</a>), learn new skills (how to swallow and feed themselves) and to provide  <a href="#4.1.9">extra iron</a> to support their  <a href="#5.1.5">rapidly growing body</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   This is why solids don't replace breastfeeding or formula until at least 12 months of age, and why your baby  <a href="#4.1.2">might not eat much solids</a>.

                    Hearing different advice on when to start introducing solids to your baby can be confusing!
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Research shows that it is best to introduce solids to your baby <a href="#4.1.1">at around 6 months</a> of age. Introducing solids <a href="#4.1.1">too early</a> can reduce the amount of important nutrients from your baby gets from breastmilk/formula. Even once they have started solids, breastmilk or formula will still continue to be an important source of nutrients until your baby is at least 12 months.

            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                    The time of day is less important than the atmosphere. Choose a time when both of you are relaxed, happy and have time to enjoy feeding. Feeding times are times of learning and love - talk to your baby while you make eye contact.

            <p class="mbn-text">
                    <a href="#4.1.8">Meal times</a> should be real family times, a time to talk with no distractions, so turn off the TV and don't answer the phone. By eating together, you are being a good role model for your child from a very young age.
            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   The only thing to be mindful of is the potential of an  <a href="#4.1.13">allergic reaction</a>. If you are worried about this, offering a new food first thing in the morning will allow you to monitor your baby for reactions throughout the day.

                    <b>Why is unsweetened plain natural yoghurt better for my baby?</b> 
            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                    Sweetened yoghurt can contain more than 3 teaspoons (15g) of sugar per 100g serve. Giving your baby sweet foods can cause your baby to  <a href="#5.1.5">gain too much weight</a>, cause tooth decay (even before the teeth have come through) and encourages your baby to get a 'sweet tooth', which makes it harder to introduce other foods that aren't as sweet, such as some  <a href="#4.1.11">vegetables</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Try adding some fruit (such as strawberries or chopped banana) to full fat unsweetened plain natural yoghurt with for natural sweetness. You might also like to check out our  <a href="#6.2.1">fruit mush and yoghurt recipe</a> in our  <a href="#6.1.1">recipes section</a>.

                    <b>If I shouldn't give my baby cow's milk as their main drink, why is it OK for them to have other dairy products like yoghurt and cheese?</b> 
            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                    Your baby's digestive system is still developing physically and cannot yet manage the proteins in cow's milk. These proteins change through the yoghurt and cheese making process. It's also likely that your baby will only eat small amounts of yoghurt and cheese, which makes them easier for your baby to digest.

                    Yes.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                  Breastmilk or formula still provide important nutrients that your baby needs for  <a href="#5.1.5">growth</a> and development between 7-12 months.

                    Your baby's kidneys are still too young to process much salt.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                  This is why you should always serve your baby's food without adding any salt and avoid giving them salty foods like fish canned in brine, corned beef, salami, feta cheese, soy sauce, chips and other salty snacks.
