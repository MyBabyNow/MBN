            <p class="mbn-text" id="4.1.15a"> Starting your baby on solids is an exciting milestone... but it can also be a time of frustration and meal time battles! </p>
            <p class="mbn-text"> Use our top tips to try to make the process as smooth as possible and give your baby the healthiest possible start. </p>
            <p class="mbn-section" id="4.1.15b"> Keep feeding your baby breastmilk/formula until 12 months </p>
            <p class="mbn-text"> Even though it is recommended that solids are introduced <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-411.html#4.1.1a');">from around 6 months</a>, breastmilk or formula are still important sources of nutrients for your baby until <i><b>at least 12 months</b></i>.
                The only thing that changes is <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-412.html#4.1.2i');">which is offered first - milk or solids</a>. </p>
            <p class="mbn-text"> After 12 months, replacing formula with regular full cream cow's milk is fine - not low and reduced fat though, as these do not have enough energy (kilojoules/calories) for your baby's <a onclick="localSecJump('sfp/sfp-515.html#5.1.5');">rapidly growing body</a>.
                By now, your baby's main nutrition should be coming from <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-418.html#4.1.8a');">family meals</a> instead of milk. </p>
            <p class="mbn-text"> Cow's milk should not be given before 12 months as it does not contain <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-419.html#4.1.9b');">enough iron</a> and can overwork your baby's kidneys, which are still developing. </p>
            <p class="mbn-section" id="4.1.15c">
            Promote healthy habits from the start </p>
            <p class="mbn-text"> The foods we offer to our babies influences the foods they learn to like, and eat, as they get older. </p>
            <p class="mbn-text"> If you want your baby to develop good eating habits right from the start, be sure to: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-418.html#4.1.8d');">set a good example</a> for your baby </li>

            <p class="mbn-text" id="4.1.15d"> <b>'Everyday' and 'Sometimes' foods</b> <br /> Rather than label foods as 'good' or 'bad', it can be useful to think about foods for everyday and sometimes foods. </p>
            <p class="mbn-text" id="4.1.15e"> <b><i>Everyday</i></b> <b>foods</b> supply important nutrients and help to keep your baby (<a onclick="localSecJump('parents/parents-714.html#7.1.4d');">and you!</a>) healthy and well. Everyday foods fit into the 5 major food groups: </p>
            <ul>
                <li class="mbn-ol"><a onclick="localSecJump('solids-4111.html#4.1.11a');">Vegetables</a> and legumes/beans </li>
                <li class="mbn-ol">Fruit </li>
                <li class="mbn-ol">Grain (cereal) foods, mostly wholegrain </li>
                <li class="mbn-ol">Lean meat and poultry, fish, eggs, nuts and seeds, and legumes/beans </li>
                <li class="mbn-ol">Milk, yoghurt, cheese and/or alternatives </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mbn-text"> By offering your baby a variety of these foods <i>every day</i>, you'll be giving your baby the best chance at optimal <a onclick="localSecJump('sfp/sfp-515.html#5.1.5');">growth</a> and development and helping your baby form healthy eating
                habits from the start. </p>
            <p class="mbn-text" id="4.1.15f"> <b><i>Sometimes</i></b> foods (which we often call 'junk foods') are full of 'empty' energy and offer very little (if any) nutrients.<b><i> Sometimes</i></b> foods include foods such as chocolate, chips, biscuits, cakes, ice cream and lollies
                (and alcohol for the adults). </p>
            <p class="mbn-text"> These foods make babies (<a onclick="localSecJump('parents/parents-714.html#7.1.4d');">and us</a>!) feel full, so they tend to replace the more nutritious <i>everyday foods</i> when we eat them, which is why we should only eat them <i>sometimes</i>.
                </p>
            <p class="mbn-text"> Giving your baby <i>sometimes</i> foods: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> means your baby will be too full <u>to eat the <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-412.html#4.1.2d');">healthy foods</a> you offer</u> and will get less of the important nutrients they need </li>
                <li>can <u>affect your baby's growth</u> when given too often - they may <a onclick="localSecJump('sfp/sfp-515.html#5.1.5');">gain too much weight</a> or develop nutrient deficiencies, in some cases </li>
                <li>can cause tooth decay (especially sugary foods) - even before the teeth have come through </li>
                <li>can be a <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-417.html#4.1.7a');">choking risk</a> - small, hard or round lollies should <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-412.html#4.1.2e');">be avoided</a> in your baby's first 12 months </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mbn-text"> Once your baby is 12 months old, it's OK for them to try these food but try to keep these for special occasions and don't keep them at home. There will be plenty of occasions for them to have <i>sometimes</i> foods at birthday parties and
                other celebrations, so there is no need to worry about them 'missing out'! </p>
            <p class="mbn-text"> When they are old enough to understand, you can then talk to them about everyday and sometimes foods, but remember not to label them as <i>good</i> and <i>bad</i>. </p>
            <p class="mbn-text"> It's also a good idea to talk to your family members (and anyone else who looks after your baby) about why you would prefer that they don't give your baby <i>sometimes</i> foods - hopefully this will stop them giving your baby these foods
                when you're not around. </p>
            <p class="mbn-section" id="4.1.15g"> No need to reward your baby with food </p>
            <p class="mbn-text"> Babies pick up habits from a young age and these often carry on as they grow older. To avoid having your child always associate receiving food as a reward, it is important that you do not give your baby any food for being 'good'. </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
            Things to be mindful of: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> when serving something sweet, try not to make a fuss about it being 'yummy' or a special reward </li>
                <li>try not to be overly strict around sweets (such as using them to reward) - this can make your baby more excited and end up promoting this food to become a favourite </li>
                <li>babies may demand <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-4115.html#4.1.15f');">sometimes foods</a> and/or sweets - this may become a way your baby tries to take control over what they eat (a potential 'battle ground'!); try not to keep these
                    foods at home and avoid the battles! </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mbn-text"> Instead of rewarding your baby's good behaviour with food, try to think of non-food rewards that your child may like. Some ideas include: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>games </li>
                <li>stories </li>
                <li> a new toy or sticker </li>
                <li> taking a trip to the park </ul>
            <p class="mbn-section" id="4.1.15h"> Babies know their own appetite </p>
            <p class="mbn-text"> Babies are excellent at knowing when they are hungry and when they have had enough. Their appetite can change from day-to-day but it also changes in response to how much they are <a onclick="localSecJump('sfp/sfp-515.html#5.1.5');">growing</a>                at the time. </p>
            <p class="mbn-text"> Things to look out for: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> watch their facial expressions and body language when feeding </li>
                <li>just like us, your baby will eat more on some days than other days - it's not always about the food offered </li>
                <li>your baby will tell you when they <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-412.html#4.1.2k');">want more</a> and when they have <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-412.html#4.1.2l');">had enough</a> </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mbn-text"> It's important that you don't force your baby to finish all the food you offer if they don't want to. Letting your baby learn to trust their appetite from an early age will help them not to overeat when they are older. </p>
            <p class="mbn-section"
              id="4.1.15i"> Food to avoid feeding your baby </p>
            <p class="mbn-text"> Remember to wait until your baby is 12 months old until you offer: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>whole nuts, raw or hard foods like carrots or apple to avoid <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-417.html#4.1.7a');">choking</a> </li>
                <li>fluids like cow's and goat's milks, juices (including 100% fruit juice), soft drinks, cordials, sport drinks, teas (including herbal) and coffee - these are <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-416.html#4.1.6a');">not suitable for babies under 12 months</a>                    </li>
                <li>honey - this can cause botulism (a serious bacterial infection) in babies under 12 months </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mbn-section" id="4.1.15j"> Try not to fuss </p>
            <p class="mbn-text"> The more you fuss about food, the more your baby will fuss. You may be tempted to give your baby a 'favourite' food if they refuse the food you have offered but this can lead to <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-4112.html#4.1.12a');">fussy eating</a>                and can make it harder for you in the long run. </p>
            <p class="mbn-text"> Instead, if your baby has refused a food or meal, simply take it away, without comment or fuss, and remain calm. </p>
            <p class="mbn-text"> Don't forget that it can take up to 10-15 exposures to a food before your baby will accept it, so try offering it again at the next regular meal or snack time, maybe even prepared in a different way. </p>
            <p class="mbn-text"> And remember, how you react to, and handle, <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-4112.html#4.1.12b');">food refusal</a> is very important in avoiding meal time battles down the track! </p>
            <p class="mbn-section" id="4.1.15k"> Your baby's food doesn't have to cost a fortune </p>
            <p class="mbn-text"> Just like with adult food, <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-415.html#4.1.5a');">packaged food</a> can be expensive and less healthy. To save money and still give your baby a <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-412.html#4.1.2d');">variety of healthy food</a>,
