            </p>    
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   It is recommended that you <a href="#4.1.1">wait until 6 months</a> before introducing solid foods to your baby's diet. This gives your baby's body time to develop to a stage where it is ready to manage solids and ensures that they are still getting all the nutrition they need from breastmilk/formula.
            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Your baby's first solid foods should be <a href="#4.1.9">high in iron</a>. This is because, from 6 months, your baby's iron needs are greater than what your breastmilk or formula can provide.

                   The order or number of foods introduced at a time doesn't really matter, just as long as your baby is getting iron rich foods that are mashed/pureed down to a <a href="#4.1.2">suitable texture for their age</a>. 
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   It won't be long before your baby will be eating much the  <a href="#4.1.8">same foods as the rest of the family</a>, just at a texture that suits them!

                    You should even give your baby foods that often considered as <i>allergenic</i>, such as:

                    This is true, even if your baby is at high risk of allergy.

             <p class="mbn-text">
                   The first thing to keep in mind is that <i>you provide</i> the food to your baby and <i>your baby decides</i> if they will eat it and if so, <i> <a href="#4.1.2">how much</a></i>. A good motto to remember is: <i> <a href="#4.1.10">parents provide, babies decide</a></i>.

            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Just like the rest of us, all babies are different, so some will enjoy solids faster than others will. At first, your baby will probably end up  <a href="#4.1.2">spitting most foods out</a>!
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Although messy, letting your baby explore their food with their fingers (including  <a href="#4.1.3">purees</a>) allows them to smell, feel and hopefully even taste new foods - it's all part of the learning experience!
            </p>

                <br>
                    To help you get started:
            </p>
             <ul>
                    <li> Until at least 8 months, start with offering solids twice a day <i>after</i> their normal breastmilk/formula feed so they still get the nutrients they need from the milk before filling up on solids.
                    </li>
                    <li> Sit at the same level as your baby and  <a href="#4.1.15">try not to fuss</a> - if they  <a href="#4.1.2">spit out</a> or  <a href="#4.1.12">refuse to accept the food</a>, just try again another time.
                    </li>   
                    <li> Offer solids when both you and your baby are happy and relaxed.
                    </li> 
                    <li> Allow your baby to sit with you when you are eating or at  <a href="#4.1.8">family meal times</a>, such as breakfast.
                    </li> 
                    <li> Over the first few weeks, gradually increase how often you offer solids.

                </ul>

                    To help you get started:
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Just as a <a href="#4.1.2">variety of different foods</a> is important, so is a variety of age-appropriate textures. In the past, most babies had to stick to pureed foods for a longer time because they started solids before they were ready but when babies start solids at around 6 months, they can begin learning about other textures fairly quickly. Varying the food texture helps your baby learn to chew (even without teeth!) as well as to swallow.
            </p>
             <p class="mbn-text">
                   Start with <a href="#4.1.3">pureed or smooth food</a> and gradually progress to <a href="#4.1.3">lumpier foods</a> as soon as your baby tolerates it. These lumpier foods will help teach your baby how to chew their food (no teeth required) which then helps them to speak.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                  Generally, if your baby is:
                <ul>
                    <li> 6-8 months - use only <a href="#4.1.3">pureed and mashed foods</a> but move to <a href="#4.1.3">minced (or mashed with a fork) and chopped foods</a> soon
                    </li>
                    <li> 8 months - begin <a href="#4.1.4">finger foods</a>
                    </li>
                    <li> 12 months - your baby might even be ready to start eating foods with the same textures enjoyed by the <a href="#4.1.8">rest of the family</a>
                    </li> 
                </ul>
            </p> 

            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Just make sure you introduce <a href="#4.1.3">lumpy food</a> before your baby is 10 months of age to avoid feeding difficulties down the track, such as only accepting smooth or soft foods.

                    <b>Signs of being hungry for solids (and full)</b>
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                  Signs that your baby is hungry for solids include:
                <ul>
                    <li>getting excited when they see you getting their food ready
                    </li>
                    <li>leaning towards you while they are sitting in the highchair
                    </li>   
                    <li>opening their mouth as you're about to feed them
                    </li> 
                </ul>
            </p> 
            <p class="mbn-text">
                  From 7-8 months, your baby may reach for the spoon or for food when they are hungry, or point to food.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                  From 8-12 months, your baby may also show excitement when you give them food.

            <p class="mbn-text">
                  Signs that your baby is hungry for solids include:
                <ul>
                    <li>refusing to eat or closing their mouth tightly
                    </li>
                    <li>pushing away the spoon, or your hand
                    </li>   
                    <li>turning their head away from you

            <p class="mbn-text">
                  If your baby shows these signs, it's important to follow their cues and not pressure them to eat or complete the meal. This encourages them to <a href="#4.1.15">trust their own appetite</a> and not to overeat when they are older.

                    <b>How to deal with food being spat out</b>
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Just because your baby spits out new foods, it doesn't always mean they don't like them - they just need time to get used to them! In fact, it can take up to 10-15 tries of a new food before your baby may accept it - so try not to give up!
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   It is normal for babies to spit out new and unknown foods, <a href="#4.1.11">especially vegetables</a>, which tend to be less sweet and more bitter than other foods. It's thought that because bitter tastes can be associated with poisons/toxins, this initial rejection of bitter foods is an instinctive reaction to protect against harm.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   If your baby spits out a food, the best thing to do is to try to <a href="#4.1.15">react calmly</a> and take the food away, before moving onto the next activity.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   Resist the temptation to offer a <a href="#4.1.12">different food</a> as this can lead to food battles and <a href="#4.1.12">fussy eating</a> down the track!
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                   As frustrating as spat out food can be, try to keep in mind that your baby needs time to explore the new <a href="#4.1.2">texture</a>/taste and they will take more in at each feed as they <a href="#5.1.5">grow</a> and get more used to solid food.
