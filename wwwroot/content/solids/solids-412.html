                When to start
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                It is recommended that you <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-411.html#4.1.1b');">wait until 6 months</a> before introducing solid foods to your baby's diet. This gives your baby's body time to develop to a stage where it is ready to manage solids and ensures that they are still getting all the nutrition they need from breastmilk/formula.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Your baby should start showing <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-411.html#4.1.1b');">signs of being ready for solids</a> around 6 months but you can also <a href="tool:use our quiz"></a> to check if your baby is ready.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Your baby's first solid foods should be <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-419.html#4.1.9b');">high in iron</a>. This is because, from 6 months, your baby's iron needs are greater than what your breastmilk or formula can provide.

                What foods to try (and avoid)
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                The order or number of foods introduced at a time doesn't really matter, just as long as your baby is getting iron rich foods that are mashed/pur&eacute;ed down to a <a onclick="localSecJump('4.1.2h');">suitable texture for their age</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                It won't be long before your baby will be eating much the <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-418.html#4.1.8a');">same foods as the rest of the family</a>, just at a texture that suits them!

                <b>How and when</b>
                <br /> The first thing to keep in mind is that <i>you provide</i> the food to your baby and <i>your baby decides</i> if they will eat it and if so, <i> <a onclick="localSecJump('4.1.2i');">how much</a></i>. A good motto to remember is: <i> <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-4110.html#4.1.10a');">parents provide, babies decide</a></i>.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Just like the rest of us, all babies are different, so some will enjoy solids faster than others will. At first, your baby will probably end up <a onclick="localSecJump('4.1.2m');">spitting most foods out</a>!
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Although messy, letting your baby explore their food with their fingers (including <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-4113.html#4.1.3h');">pur&eacute;es</a>) allows them to smell, feel and hopefully even taste new foods - it's all part of the learning experience!
            </p>

            <p class="mbn-text" id="4.1.2g">
                To help you get started:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Until at least 8 months, start with offering solids twice a day <i>after</i> their normal breastmilk/formula feed so they still get the nutrients they need from the milk before filling up on solids.
                </li>
                <li> Sit at the same level as your baby and <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-4115.html#4.1.15j');">try not to fuss</a> - if they <a onclick="localSecJump('4.1.2m');">spit out</a> or <a onclick="localSecJump('4.1.12a');">refuse to accept the food</a>, just try again another time.
                </li>
                <li> Offer solids when both you and your baby are happy and relaxed.
                </li>
                <li> Allow your baby to sit with you when you are eating or at <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-418e .html#4.1.8e');">family meal times</a>, such as breakfast.
                </li>
                <li> Over the first few weeks, gradually increase how often you offer solids.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mbn-text" id="4.1.2h">
                <b>Textures</b>
                <br /> Just as a <a onclick="localSecJump('4.1.2d');">variety of different foods</a> is important, so is a variety of age-appropriate textures. In the past, most babies had to stick to pur&eacute;ed foods for a longer time because they started solids before they were ready but when babies start solids at around 6 months, they can begin learning about other textures fairly quickly. Varying the food texture helps your baby learn to chew (even without teeth!) as well as to swallow.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Start with <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-413.html#4.1.3h');">pur&eacute;ed or smooth food</a> and gradually progress to <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-413.html#4.1.3k');">lumpier foods</a> as soon as your baby tolerates it. These lumpier foods will help teach your baby how to chew their food (no teeth required) which then helps them to speak.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Generally, if your baby is:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> 6-8 months - use only <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-413.html#4.1.3h');">pur&eacute;ed and mashed foods</a> but move to <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-413.html#4.1.3k');">minced (or mashed with a fork) and chopped foods</a> soon
                </li>
                <li> 8 months - begin <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-414.html#4.1.4a');">finger foods</a>
                </li>
                <li> 12 months - your baby might even be ready to start eating foods with the same textures enjoyed by the <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-418.html#4.1.8a');">rest of the family</a>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mbn-text">
                Just make sure you introduce <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-413.html#4.1.3k');">lumpy food</a> before your baby is 10 months of age to avoid feeding difficulties down the track, such as only accepting smooth or soft foods.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">

                At first, your baby will probably only eat very small amounts. Learning how to swallow new textures is just like any other new skill - it takes time to master!

                Signs of being hungry for solids (and full)
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Signs that your baby is hungry for solids include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>getting excited when they see you getting their food ready
                </li>
                <li>leaning towards you while they are sitting in the highchair
                </li>
                <li>opening their mouth as you're about to feed them
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mbn-text">
                From 7-8 months, your baby may reach for the spoon or for food when they are hungry, or point to food.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                From 8-12 months, your baby may also show excitement when you give them food.
            </p>

            <p class="mbn-text" id="4.1.2l">
                Signs that your baby is no longer hungry include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>refusing to eat or closing their mouth tightly
                </li>
                <li>pushing away the spoon, or your hand
                </li>
                <li>turning their head away from you
                </li>
                <li>looking upset or starting to cry
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mbn-text">
                If your baby shows these signs, it's important to follow their cues and not pressure them to eat or complete the meal. This encourages them to <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-4115.html#4.1.15h');">trust their own appetite</a> and not to overeat when they are older.

                How to deal with food being spat out
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Just because your baby spits out new foods, it doesn't always mean they don't like them - they just need time to get used to them! In fact, it can take up to 10-15 tries of a new food before your baby may accept it - so try not to give up!
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                It is normal for babies to spit out new and unknown foods, <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-4111.html#4.1.11a');">especially vegetables</a>, which tend to be less sweet and more bitter than other foods. It's thought that because bitter tastes can be associated with poisons/toxins, this initial rejection of bitter foods is an instinctive reaction to protect against harm.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                If your baby spits out a food, the best thing to do is to try to <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-4115.html#4.1.15j');">react calmly</a> and take the food away, before moving onto the next activity.
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                Resist the temptation to offer a <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-4112.html#4.1.12g');">different food</a> as this can lead to food battles and <a onclick="localSecJump('solids-4112.html#4.1.12a');">fussy eating</a> down the track!
            </p>
            <p class="mbn-text">
                As frustrating as spat out food can be, try to keep in mind that your baby needs time to explore the new <a onclick="localSecJump('4.1.2h');">texture</a>/taste and they will take more in at each feed as they <a onclick="localSecJump('sfp/sfp-515.html#5.1.5');">grow</a> and get more used to solid food.
